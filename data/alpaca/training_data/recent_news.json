Instead of it being Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the movie instead uses a broad cryptocurrency term for the mention. An article from QZ highlights the new movie also covering the trending topic of artificial intelligence. What if artificial intelligence surpassed humans and went on to rule the world? Would we start begging AI to spare our lives? These are some of the questions that linger in viewers minds after watching, the article reads. An AI tool called The Entity is used in the movie and can perform tasks like scrubbing live video feeds, crack security codes and impersonate people. In the movie, the AI tool goes rogue, which may feed into a fear that some have about the growth of AI technology worldwide. Ethan Hunt and the IMF team must track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands, the movies plot reads.

Heres a look at how much an investment from the time the case was announced is worth today. Landmark Court Ruling For Crypto Sector: U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres determinedthe sale of the XRP token by Ripple is not an offer of investment contracts. The ruling comes after Ripple has spent a significant amount of money fighting claims that XRP was a security. Torres said that some assets can serve as an investment contract, including digital tokens. In the case of the XRP token, it is not a security, according to the ruling. Alongside the ruling, the judge found Ripples sales of XRP to institutions to be in violation of the Securities Act. This ruling could become a key item to watch for the cryptocurrency sector moving forward. Ripple and its community score a win Thursday with the declaration by the judge that XRP is not a security, which could also set a precedent, as the SEC has alleged that several cryptocurrencies are securities. The case between the SEC and Ripple remains active, with the potential for a trial by jury or settlement between the two parties moving forward. Crypto Exchanges Welcome Back XRP News: of the ruling sent the price of the XRP token significantly higher and also has cryptocurrency exchanges adding the token back after prior delistings.

Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) also announced it is adding XRP back. Coinbase will re-enable trading for XRP (XRP) on the XRP network. Trading is anticipated to begin later today, if liquidity conditions are met, Coinbase tweeted. Ripple praised the ruling with a tweet. XRP is not a security. This victory for Ripple is a win for the entire industry and a step toward regulatory clarity in the U.S.A. Ripple said. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) also highlighted the significance of the ruling. The Ripple case is a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. Now lets make it law, Emmer said. The ruling comes after the SEC charged Ripple and executives Christian Larsen and Bradley Garlinghouse of conducting an unregistered securities offering of $1.3 billion. The charges were announced on Dec. 22, 2020.

Also Read:Chat, Pay and Play All in One Place With Coinbase Wallet POL is designed as a third-generation native asset, termed a \"hyperproductive token.\"\r\nPOL differs from Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) in that it: Allows holders to validate multiple chains and perform multiple roles within each chain. Ensures ecosystem security through a decentralized pool of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators Supports infinite scalability Provides ecosystem support through a sustainable, in-protocol mechanism Enables community ownership by holding governance rights. POL also revolves around validators, aligning and incentivizing them to perform useful work. Validators are required to stake POL to join the validator set, which prevents Sybil attacks, aligns validators with the ecosystem's success, and enables the punishment of malicious validators. Polygon, an Ethereum scaling platform, proposes to introduce continuous POL emission to fund a Community Treasury, a self-sustainable ecosystem fund that can support protocol development, research, ecosystem grants, and adoption incentives. The upgrade from MATIC to POL requires sending MATIC to the upgrade smart contract, which will automatically return the equivalent amount of POL. Token holders will be given ample time, possibly four years or more, to upgrade. If the community consensus supports this proposal, the migration could start within months.

Bitcoin is better than currency in that you dont have to be physically in the same place, and for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient.

What Happened: This unprecedented spike followed the recent unveiling of a new AI company called xAI, spearheaded by tech mogul Elon Musk. As of the time of writing, XAI was observed trading at a remarkably low value of $0.000000005126. It is important to note that caution should be exercised when interpreting this value due to the extremely low trading volumes associated with XAI. In the past 24 hours, the trading volume for this cryptocurrency amounted to just $327,114. Unlike Musks existing X Corp., xAI will operate as a distinct entity, but collaborative efforts with his other companies are expected. The chosen moniker, xAI, pays homage to Musks earlier endeavors, particularly X.com. Launched in December 1999, X.com stood as a pioneering online banking website. In a twist of fate, it merged with PayPal Holdings Inc, another venture co-founded by Musk, in March 2000 before eventually becoming an independent entity. Musk reacquired rights to the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, repurposing it for his latest venture. See More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's Octopussy Why It Matters: This latest leap into the AI space by Musk comes as no surprise to avid followers of his ventures.

What Happened: The tech giants new rules, scheduled for full implementation by the end of the year, aim to offer clear guidelines and transparency for blockchain game developers. Google said in a blog post, according to the updated policy, developers of blockchain games will be required to disclose the games status as a blockchain game on the content page of the Google Play Store. They must also clearly inform users if any in-app products in the Android games have corresponding NFTs. Importantly, Google will allow NFTs to unlock in-app content, regardless of where the NFT was purchased, in contrast to Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) current restrictions. \"As part of the policy update, we're requiring that apps be transparent with users about tokenized digital assets,\" Google said in a blog post.

Publishing apps to the Apple App Store requires adherence to the App Store Review Guidelines, which serve as a crucial set of rules for developers. These guidelines outline what is permissible and what is not, providing developers with clear instructions on what they can and cannot publish on the platform. Failure to comply with these policies may result in app rejection or removal from the App Store. NFTs are digital assets that are based on blockchain technology, most commonly Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC).

What Happened: If the meme crypto were to reach $10 from todays price of $0.065, it would signify a staggering gain of approximately 15,246.15%.

Little did they expect that their humorous creation would transcend its origins, evolving into a bona fide cryptocurrency with a committed community. See More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's Octopussy Why It Matters: Musks influence on Dogecoin cannot be understated. His tweets have had a direct impact on the cryptocurrencys popularity and price surge. Scarcity plays a crucial role in driving price movements, particularly in the case of Bitcoin, the most prominent cryptocurrency. Bitcoins value is influenced by its finite supply of 26 million coins, with increasing demand driving up prices. However, the situation is different for Dogecoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin does not face this scarcity issue, as it currently has an unlimited supply. In practical terms, this means that more Dogecoins can be created at will. According to Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Dogecoins inflation does not undermine its value; instead, it solidifies its usefulness as a digital currency.

This 45-year-old Dutch investor made headlines in 2017 when he exchanged his familys possessions, including their spacious home, for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), setting them on a nomadic journey, CNBC reported. The Familys Strategy: The report states Taihuttus investment strategy revolves around capitalizing on Bitcoins price volatility. He regularly converts his Bitcoin into stablecoins during peak market periods, only to buy it back during bear markets. His strategy, guided by a market indicator he created, known as the Didi BAM BAM, has proven successful. Using a mix of directional trading data and moon cycles as inputs, Taihuttus indicator signaled the end of the bear market in late 2022, leading him to reenter the bitcoin market. This move has yielded gains of around 50% since the market bottom. The Nitty-Gritty: The exact value of Taihuttus crypto investments remains undisclosed, but he tells CNBC they were brought back into bitcoin when it crossed the $19,000 mark. Taihuttu familys primary residence is in Portugal, a country that offers favorable tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. In Portugal, capital gains on cryptocurrencies are exempt from taxation, making it an attractive destination for crypto enthusiasts.

Otherwise, it's going to be not nice. And then I look at ETH, if this stays (like) this for two, three, four more weeks that resistance should be cooked.\" The trader adds that if ETH manages to rise above $1,935, it could trigger a rapid rally, potentially taking ETH to a level last witnessed in May 2022, before the collapse of the Terra Classic (LUNC) ecosystem. \"To the upside, we close above $1,935, it seems pretty damn clear that we're going to go to $2,500.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

With the 2024 campaign season approaching, and Democrats controlling the Senate, time is running out for GOP lawmakers to formalize their proposals. Ron Hammond of the Blockchain Association acknowledges the Senate as a significant hurdle for potential legislation, Bloomberg reported. See Also: Dubai's BitOasis Stumbles As VARA Halts Its Operational License Over Regulatory Non-Compliance Despite legal challenges, the SEC continues to assert its jurisdiction over crypto and enforce strict rules for investor protection. The agency has sued major crypto exchanges, causing uncertainty in the industry, and has impeded the establishment of a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund and sought greater control over stablecoins. Crypto advocates argue that the SEC's approach exceeds its mandate, advocating for many tokens to be classified as commodities rather than securities. Republican lawmakers Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson offer hope for regulatory relief with their proposal, which aims to differentiate digital assets as commodities or securities. This could limit the SEC's discretion and shift oversight to the more flexible Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the CFTC warns of being a strict overseer based on past enforcement actions. Under the McHenry-Thompson plan, a token's classification would depend on the level of decentralization of its associated blockchain network. The proposal also allows assets initially considered securities to be regulated as commodities and calls for the SEC to adapt rules for crypto trading platforms. The outlook for the legislation dims as Democratic Representative Maxine Waters expresses concerns and emphasizes the importance of collaboration, particularly with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Gensler. Waters believes that existing rules are sufficient and accuses digital-asset firms of noncompliance. Lobbyist Alex Grieve predicts only a 20% chance of the legislation becoming law without substantial Democratic support. The level of bipartisanship will determine the Senate's attention to the bill. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees have been less involved, with only one combined hearing on crypto this year. Senator Sherrod Brown, who chairs the Banking Committee, generally supports the SEC's current role but recognizes the need to address industry abuses and collaborate with regulators. Despite the challenges, industry advocates remain hopeful, citing promising conversations between Republicans and Democrats. Brett Quick of the Crypto Council for Innovation emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and modifications to the proposed legislation. Stablecoins present a potential area of agreement, as both parties view them as unregulated threats to financial stability. Waters is willing to negotiate with Republicans on a stablecoin plan.

What Happened: With a price target of $430 for Microstrategy, Berenberg Capital Market wrote in a research note, seen by The Block, that the companys substantial value derived from its extensive Bitcoin holdings, which currently exceed 150,000 BTC. The research note posits that the established historical pattern of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surging after halving events is likely to repeat, bolstering Microstrategys prospects. Bitcoin halvings are periodic occurrences that reduce the rate of new coin issuance by 50%, effectively slowing down the pace at which fresh tokens enter the market. The fourth Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 26, 2024. Berenberg Capital Market emphasizes that if the historical trend observed after the previous three halvings persist, a pre-halving rally could commence in approximately four months. See More: A Stay At The Floating Palace From James Bond's Octopussy Why It Matters: The firm states, If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025. According to a report by Bloomberg on July 8, the upcoming Bitcoin halving could have a detrimental effect on miner profits. Jaran Mellerud, a crypto mining analyst at Hashrate Index, revealed that nearly half of Bitcoin miners currently operate with suboptimal efficiency. As a result, these miners are expected to face significant challenges following the halving event. Mellerud explained that the break-even electricity price for the most common mining machines is projected to decrease from $0.12/kilowatt-hour to $0.06/kWh after the halving. However, approximately 40% of BTC miners operate at costs higher than $0.06/kWh, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the halvings impact. This situation could particularly affect miners with operating costs above $0.08/kWh and those who do not possess their mining rigs.

However, its rise to fame has sparked questions about whether it may be yet another scam in the world of meme coins. What Happened: To fully comprehend the significance of Squid 2.0 Coin, it is essential to revisit the origins of its predecessor. During the height of the 2021 crypto trading frenzy, a token named Squid Game emerged, riding on the wave of popularity generated by the Netflix original series of the same name. SQUID began trading on October 20, 2021, following the release of the hit Netflix Series in September. The white paper indicated that it sold out \"in seconds\". It began trading for just a few cents but recently rose over 50,000% to highs of just under $11. The team claimed that Elon Musk has pumped Squid Game tokens, yet there was no evidence of this. The token claimed to reward holders with 7% interest for holding the token and also earn Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) from playing the game. Unfortunately, this hype soon turned sour as the Squid Game project revealed its true colors as a crypto scam. Initially marketed as a play-to-earn cryptocurrency inspired by the South Korean hit series, investors quickly discovered that they had fallen victim to a rug pull.

What Happened: In an interview with CNBCs Jim Cramer, Massad said the need for regulation that does not require lengthy litigation processes. He said, \"Litigation takes a long time and, quite frankly, the crypto industry may find it's in their interest to stretch these cases out, because they may be hoping for a change in regulatory attitude with the 2024 election. The second reason is, it won't resolve all the issues that we need to get resolved.\" The suggested self-regulatory organization (SRO) would be a collaborative effort between the SEC and CFTC. Its primary objective would be to establish fundamental standards pertaining to asset protection, fraud prevention, conflicts of interest, and reporting and record-keeping obligations for platforms involved in the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).

The leading global market maker is responsible for executing more than 33% of individual investors orders, \"so the only way that you can use the presence of Citadel to your advantage, is to know where the supply and demand imbalances are.\" CVNA), MTDR), U), and COIN). S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Ease As Traders Await CPI Report: Whats Driving Markets Monday He emphasized the difficulties associated with trading a highly volatile stock such as Carvana, which exhibits an approximately 10% volatility. To tackle the trading challenges posed by such stocks, Quast recommended implementing a stop-loss order that should be positioned considerably below the stocks acquisition price to accommodate the heightened volatility. The trade-off here is increased risk, but with careful consideration of the stocks behavior, traders can increase their chances of turning in a profit. Despite volatility and risk, Quast suggests that theres a high mathematical probability of making a 2%-4% gain on those types of trades. \"The entry will take care of itself as long as your exit is 2%,\" he said. His advice is simple: Just take what the market gives you. The 2%-4% principle guides his internal model, which netted a 37.2% return by mid-year.Though, if youre more of a passive investor, there are momentum trading-focused ETFs like the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (BATS:MTUM), and the Invesco DWA Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP), so you can skirt the traditional approach to momentum trading. Quasts strategy for momentum trading is consistent with the fundamental definition of the approach, where the emphasis is on leading rather than following the crowd. The idea is to ride the wave of a stocks upward trend and sell as soon as there are signs of a downward trend, moving the capital to new positions. Key elements of momentum investing include choosing the right stocks (Quast mentioned the four above), understanding risks in opening and closing trades, opening trades early, managing the position, and consistent charting for profitable exit points. Above all, investors must understand that the aim is not to make a killing on a single trade, but to make modest gains that compound over time. As Quast puts it, you have to take what the market gives you and use it to your advantage.

These allegations stem from a detailed investigation led by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT. Originally known for his gaming and trolling content, which allowed him to amass over 122,000YouTube subscribers, Blue switched gears in 2021 and entered into more nefarious activities. According to a series of tweets by ZachXBT, Blue has been associated with Monkey Drainer and other such services to perpetrate phishing scams, leading to significant losses. One particularly damning piece of evidence highlighted by ZachXBT was a leaked Snapchat post from Blue himself. This post reportedly displayed the Ethereum Name Service (CRYPTO: ENS) address, cool-breeze.eth, linked to the purchase of a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT. Further investigation into the funding of this address revealed inflows of over 85 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), equivalent to approximately a third of the stolen funds, traced back to numerous addresses linked with Monkey Drainer's phishing scams. Ironically, Blue himself was reportedly robbed of his BAYC NFT in late 2022 after allegedly scamming Monkey Drainer. This setbackdid not deter him. Blue allegedly returned to scamming shortly afterward, making purchases of luxury items, including a high-end watch, a carand even rare Roblox items using stolen funds. Also Read:Binance's Launchpad Gears Up Tor Arkham Token Sale, Starts Recording BNB Balances These ostentatious acquisitions were then flaunted on his personal Snapchat. Blue's preferred method of scamming seems to involve spamming Twitter with verified accounts. Two of the most recent victims were @g13m and @ystrickler, from whom he allegedlymanaged to steal substantial cryptocurrency assets while working in collaboration with different phishing services. The modus operandi in the case of @g13m involved a fake Doodles site, through which Blue managed to siphon off 49 ETH and 74,000USDT, netting him approximately $213,000after accounting for the drainer's fee. The on-chain sleuth further stated that Blue has shown no remorse for his actions, even going as far as to commission a video mocking one of his victims, LoveMake, who lost a significant amount of funds due to Blue's phishing scam. The brazen nature of his actions has led to widespread disgust among the cryptocurrency community, with many hoping to see legal action taken against him. ZachXBT has shared additional information about Blue with his victims, to aid potential legal pursuits.

Photo: Shutterstock", "As always on Sunday's, we will start by taking a look at the S&P from a higher timeframe. For the third time, the market rejected the monthly bearish order block, back from March of 2022. It is interesting to note that despite the harsh afternoon sell off on Friday, ES held the bottom of the weekly bearish imbalance that was created back in April of 2022. Bulls want to see that level hold as support, for a potential move back up to fill the imbalance at 4503. There is a weekly volume imbalance down near 4300 (shown above) that I think will get tested at some point, but the question I am asking myself is will it be before or after this current bearish imbalance fills... This week there are multiple FED Speakers, in addition to CPI and PPI data. ES DAILY - Nasty candle Friday, setting up another bearish volume imbalance. Two levels I am looking towards to offer some support are 4425 and 4417. If ES is to slip up I see some downside to 4389, which is a daily bullish order block dating back to 6/27... If support holds up my upside target to fill in the current bearish imbalance is 4503. NQ QQQ- Nasdaq has been leading the charge for some time now, so I felt it was worth charting for the week. NQ has 3 levels of support I'm watching, with the 1 resistance level I am watching being the bearish volume imbalance that formed on Friday. The one thing throwing in a major wrench for me this week is DXY. The dollar looks pretty bearish, with a nasty candle being put in on Friday, slicing through support. Last week, the dollar rejected the 50% level of the current range again, also setting lower highs on the daily timeframe. Without a strong bounce back Monday, DXY can set up a bearish imbalance for more downside. BTC(CRYPTO: BTC) - I drew the forecast about two weeks ago now, and it has pretty much moved in slow motion... While I still favor a move towards 32k, I'd prefer that bitcoin did not drop into support a second time, and would like to see some bullish order flow come in to drive price higher, quickly. KEY: Green box - support or bullish imbalances Red box - resistance or bearish imbalances Blue lines - swing high or swing low aka liquidity Orange lines - imbalance mid point Purple lines - Order Blocks (+OB = Bullish, -OB = Bearish) SPY 1H - 1H is sooo clean. Low of range set on a bounce off hourly bullish order block. Fill and Bounce from bullish imbalance formed at 12PM Thursday. Retracement into bearish imbalance and .79 level. FLUSH AAPL(NASDAQ:AAPL) - premarket bounce from support created Thursday morning up to the dreaded 192.50 level that has rejected about 17 times in the last week. Price flushed hard, creating some resistance on the way down, before finding support again. Below support at 190.50 and I'll look for lower prices. TSLA (NASDAQ:TSLA) - Range set on Thursday and rejected a premium imbalance (above 50%). I think TSLA is in a pretty big spot... A hold here and I think prices can bounce and challenge the high of 284.25. Taking out the low of 272.88 and I think a staircase down can start to set up. GOOGL (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - ran into resistance formed on Thursday at 121, before falling back down into support. Biggest area to hold on GOOGL for me is 118.40 support. Since Wednesday, there have been multiple levels of resistance formed. MARA (NASDAQ:MARA) - still following trend, with a run into resistance and setting a new short term high. Rejected to the tick and pulled back into support. If my BTC idea plays out, MARA has some more room to the upside. AMZN (NASDAQ:AMZN) - strong day on Friday, but is still in the range it has been stuck in for quite some time now. Bulls would have to defend that 129.50 level for a push higher back into that resistance level it has been struggling with. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) - I did a price recap short on my YouTube channel, which may help those who are still learning how I go about this... Pretty big spot to hold here if bulls want that push back to 118.

The bank speculatedthe surging value of Bitcoin might incentivize Bitcoin \"miners\" to accumulate more units. Previously in April, the bankprojected a $100,000 valuation for Bitcoin by the end of 2024, anticipating the end of the \"crypto winter,\" Geoff Kendrick, one of the leading FX analysts at the bank, now perceives a 20% potential increase to that estimate. Kendrick suggested in his report, \"Increased miner profitability per BTC (Bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher.\" Despite a substantial 80% growth in the value of Bitcoin since the beginning of the year, its present value of roughly $30,200 remains significantly less than its previous peak of $69,000 in November 2021. Also Read:Bitcoin, Ethereum And Now Mantle? New Layer-2 Network Proposes $200M Ecosystem Fund The crypto sector underwent substantial losses in 2022, with trillions of dollars eradicated as a result of central bank rate hikes and several crypto firms' failures, including the FTXexchange. However, the downfall of several traditional banks this year has contributed to a resurgence in crypto value. Standard Chartered assertedthat its price prediction was based on the idea that Bitcoin miners, who currently generate 900 new Bitcoin daily worldwide, wouldneed to sell fewer Bitcoin to cover their operational costs,primarily electricity for high-performance computers. According to Kendrick, miners have been selling all of their newly minted coins recently. But if the price reaches $50,000, the sale percentage would likely drop to 20%-30%. \"It is the equivalent of miners reducing the amount of Bitcoin they sell per day to just 180-270 from 900 currently,\" he said. If this trend persists, the annual selling of Bitcoin by miners would reduce drastically from 328,500 to a range of 65,700-98,550, leading to a significant decrease in the net BTC supply of approximately 250,000 Bitcoin per year. Furthermore, due to an intrinsic supply and issuance mechanism designed to preserve Bitcoin's value, the daily limit of minable Bitcoin isprojected to halve next April or May.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space.

Scalability has been a persistent topic of debate between Bitcoin and Ethereum for many years. Ethereumtransitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network, while simultaneously experimenting with various Layer 2 solutions such asZK-rollups and Plasma. Meanwhile, the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, has been pivotal in its scalability. Recently, the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals has further augmented Bitcoin's network, transforming it into more than just a payment layer. Also Read:Bitcoin, Ethereum And Now Mantle?

Note the following: The chart shows that unlike theU.S., the Chinese market has not staged a significant rally this year.China is important because it is the second largest economy in the world. The stock market rally in theU.S. is driven by theAIfrenzy that has caused money to flow into seven magnificent stocks.The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc(NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). China is the biggest competitor to theU.S. in artificial intelligence. The chart shows that theAIrally in Chinese stocks has fizzled. China is close to deflation.Consumer Price Index (CPI) in China is important for the Chinese domestic economy, but Producer Price Index (PPI) in China is important for the rest of the world, including theU.S. For this reason, investors should pay attention to PPI in China.Here is the data:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tChinas CPI came at 0.0% year-over-year vs. 0.2% consensus.\r\n\t\tPPI in China came at -5.4% year-over-year vs. -5% consensus.\r\n\t\tPPI in China has now fallen for nine consecutive months. China is the factory to the world.As producer prices in China fall, prices of exports from China also fall.This is helpingreducegoods inflation in theU.S. and making overall inflation numbers look good. As we have written before, in The Arora Report analysis, it is the core services inflation ex-housing that is important for investors.This includes items such as cost of travel, restaurants, and haircuts.The Fed is also focused on core services inflation. In The Arora Report analysis to counter deflation, the Chinese government is likely to provide stimulus.Investors love stimulus as stimulus creates more money.Apart of the stimulus money rushes into the stock markets. In The Arora Report analysis, investors should not get too optimistic about stimulus in China because the Chinese government is likely to exercise restraint due to massive debt issues at the local government level. All eyes are on CPI that will be released on Wednesday, July 12 at 8:30am ET.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe consensus for both headline and core CPI is 0.3%.\r\n\t\tWhisper numbers are 0.2% for headline CPI, and that is the reason momo gurus are using to prompt buying of stocks ahead of CPI release.As is their pattern, the momo crowd is buying ahead of key data on hope strategy. In contrast, smart money takes risk control measures ahead of key data.Our decades of experience show that in the long term, hope is not a good investing strategy. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is the worlds largest contract semiconductor manufacturer.TSMmanufactures chips for the likes of Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).TSMreported June 2023 revenues declined 11.1% year-over-year. Negative data fromTSMcomes on the heels of negative semiconductor production data from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC:SSNLF). Prudent investors need to make note of the semiconductor production data fromTSMand Samsung since semiconductors have been the leading sector in this years stock market rally. Investors have been running up semiconductor stocks on theAIfrenzy and also on the assumption that the order downdraft has bottomed. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents.

Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative.This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 21% - 39% in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 3% - 6%, and short term hedges of 5% - 8%. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Wozniak, who played a pivotal role in the early days of personal computing alongside Steve Jobs, has consistently recognized the technical merits of Bitcoin and referred to it as the most amazing mathematical miracle even during a previous tech conference.

What Happened: Brandt took aim at cryptocurrency enthusiasts who vocally denounce the US dollar while simultaneously holding assets via Tether on Binance, referring to the exchange as the scam of the decade. Tether is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin, designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to the US dollar.

At present, Bitcoin is being traded at $27,536 against the US dollar on the exchange, representing approximately an 8.5% discount from the global spot USD prices, which currently stand at $30,106.

Even stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are trading below their intended value, with a value of $0.915 on the exchange. These discounted prices might seem appealing to arbitragers who seek to profit from price differences between exchanges. However, the reality is that most investors cannot take advantage of these discounts due to restrictions imposed by Binance.US.

Binance.US has reportedly informed its customers, through an email circulated on Twitter, that the last day for USD withdrawals will be on July 20. This announcement has added to the uncertainty surrounding the platform and has contributed to the persisting discounted prices. Jim Chanos, an American investment manager, questioned why such large arbitrage opportunities exist between major exchanges like this if cryptocurrencies are indeed considered a next-gen solution to fiat currencies.
