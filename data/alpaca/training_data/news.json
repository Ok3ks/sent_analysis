Commonly referred to as the Bored Apes, only 10,000 generative art pieces will ever be in existence. What happened: Bored Ape #1239 just sold for 48.69 ETH (CRYPTO: ETH) ($90,765 USD). The value of Bored Apes is typically determined by the Ape's attributes, with the laser eyes, crown, and golden fur traits being the most coveted. Here are a list of its attributes and how many others have the same trait: Background: New Punk Blue (1,232) Eyes: Sunglasses (352) Fur: Black (1,229) Hat: Beanie (578) Mouth: Bored (2,272) Clothes: Bone Tee (230) Why it Matters: Bored Apes are the ultimate store of culture for NFT collectors. The NFT collection has gained huge influence in 2021, with an ever growing list of top tier celebrities making apes their profile pictures on Twitter. With the recent explosion in popularity surrounding the Metaverse, rare blockchain-based avatars are all the rage for those looking to flex online. Being a member of the Bored Ape Yacht Club is not just about flexing online. Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Apes throw exclusive parties often with free private performances from members of the club such as Lil Baby. Other notable celebrities in the club include Post Malone, Stephen Curry, Dez Bryant, and Jimmy Kimmel. Yuga Labs also created another NFT collection known as the Mutant Apes, which also provides membership to the elusive club. There are a total of 20,000 Mutant Apes, and the price floor is historically lower than the Bored Apes. See Also: NFT Release Calendar and Best NFT Projects of 2021 Data provided by OpenSea.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -15.56%.

As a result, more than $500 million in digital assets held in TRON multisig accounts were threatened. Also Read:XRP Breaks Chains: Epic Surge Amid Tense Ripple-SEC Showdown Why It Matters: TRON is a significant player in the global blockchain arena. It boasts over 144 million users and ranks second to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and stablecoin circulation. The blockchain network utilizes multisig or Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for creating joint accounts. In this setup, a threshold of signers is required to approve a transaction, effectively providing enhanced security. The recently discovered vulnerability exploited an assumption in TRON's multisig transaction verification process: that there cannot be two different valid signatures for the same message by the same individual. This was proven false in light of TRON's ECDSA signature scheme. This flaw could allow the generation of multiple valid signatures for the same message using the same private key. 0d Suggests Two Attack Scenarios An attacker with at least one weight permission could execute transactions in every multisig wallet, regardless of the threshold. An attacker could exploit a transaction partially signed by someone with permissions, but without reaching the threshold. The vulnerability has been addressed by TRON after the report from 0d. The solution was simple: Checking the signed address against the list of addresses instead of matching the signature against the list of signatures. This fix effectively secures the TRON blockchain network, protecting the assets of its vast user base. Meanwhile, a TRON representative told The Block that they indeed received a bug report from HackerOne. The team sprung into action to rectify the issue and implemented the needed fixes to prevent any possible exploitation of the vulnerability. The detected problem has been successfully dealt with, thus reinstating the security of the system.

While some used the money for bills and to boost their savings, others chose to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies. The CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment. The subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020.

Expressing his enthusiasm regarding the new offering,Egor Danilov, general manager of Key App, emphasized the potential of this breakthrough in mitigating issues of high transaction fees and enhancing the overall user experience, extending beyond just crypto-savvy individuals to include the general public. Bridges in the cryptocurrency world, pivotal for transactions between different networks, currently encapsulate about $42 billion in total locked value (TVL). The continuing expansion of this volume elucidates the persistent user demand for cross-chain transactions, despite the exorbitant costs associated with it. But, there is a glaring deficit of feasible solutions that can simplify the process.

The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been trading mostly sideways since May 12 and on Thursday, the crypto fell to the $25,864 mark and bounced up from the level. The price action caused Bitcoin to print a bullish double bottom pattern when paired to similar price action on May 12. On Friday, Bitcoin was reacting to the pattern and bouncing up above Thursdays high-of-day, but the crypto rejected an upper descending trend line, which has been holding it down since May 6. If Bitcoin can break through the trend line, a longer-term reversal to the upside could be on the horizon. Bitcoin has resistance above at $27,133 and $28,690 and support below at $25,772 and $25,288 The Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is trading under a descending trend line, which has been holding the crypto down since May 6. Ethereum also rejected the area during Fridays session, but if the crypto can break above the trend line, a big reversal could be on deck. If Ethereum is unable to break through the trend line, it may continue to push the crypto lower. If that happens, bullish traders want to see Ethereum hold above $1,737 or a longer-term downtrend could be on the horizon. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,846 and $1,957 and support below at $1,717 and $1,564. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin is also trading under a descending trendline, which has been forcing the crypto lower since April 3. Like Bitcoin, Dogecoin formed a double bottom pattern on May 11 and May 25 near 7 cents and was attempting to break higher on Friday. Bullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Dogecoin above the trend line. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and push the crypto under the 7-cent mark, which could signal a downtrend is in the cards.

The collection consists of over 97,000 plots of land  at the current moment each plot Land parcels are 16m x 16m, or 52 square feet. Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses.

They argue that both assets are perceived as investment alternatives and usually share a synchronized movement. \"Investors are currently holding gold for investment purposes outside of central banks to the tune of around $3 trillion, which, if paralleled with Bitcoin, presents a $45,000 price. This projection is based on the assumption that Bitcoin's value will match that of gold in private investors' portfolios, in terms of risk capital or volume,\" The Block quoted a note from the team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou at JPMorgan as saying. The analysts envision the $45,000 Bitcoin price as a ceiling, suggesting a constrained growth potential for the cryptocurrency, except for the increase linked to the doubling of its mining or production costs. They further mention that the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, an event that reduces the reward for mining new bitcoins by half, could push Bitcoin's production cost to roughly $40,000. Also Read:The Next Crypto Sensation: Base's Mainnet Launch And What It Means For You \"Historically, Bitcoin's production cost has acted as an effective minimum limit. Past halving events in 2016 and 2020 triggered an uptick in bitcoin prices that gathered momentum post the halving event,\" JPMorgan's strategists explained. In anticipation of the halving event in 2024, JPMorgan forecasts a 25% Bitcoin return over the following year. On the subject of Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), JPMorgan predicts continued selling pressure in the short term, possibly extending beyond the mid-year mark following the Shanghai upgrade. The bank foresees Ethereum slightly lagging behind Bitcoin during this period. Despite these predictions, JPMorgan remains guarded regarding digital assets.

The most pressing issue is the lingering deadlock over the debt limit, which will ultimately decide if the US government can meet its financial obligations. Despite some positive developments as reported by Republican House lawmakers on Thursday, its still unclear if the parties involved can reach a resolution in time to prevent a possible government default.

Bitcoin is performing better than gold as investors struggle with assessing recessionary fears, positive flows into stocks, and overall optimism that the US won't default. Debt ceiling angst remains despite all the optimistic comments from Speaker McCarthy. This latest round of dollar strength probably won't last and it will be interesting to see if market stress eventually triggers flows back into crypto,\" said Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA. According to renowned crypto analyst Jason Pizzino, Bitcoin may experience a significant double-digit surge once it surpasses a crucial resistance zone. Pizzino highlighted that the $28,000 to $32,000 level is posing a major obstacle for the leading crypto asset. Pizzino believes that once Bitcoin manages to break through this significant resistance, it could potentially surge by as much as 80% from its current price level. \"So $28,500 to around $32,000 is going to be a key level for Bitcoin to overcome. I suspect when it does, you will start to see less of the bears and more of the bulls, he said. According to Pizzino, BTC will be then looking towards $48,000 as the next level. And of course the all-time highs.\" Crypto analyst Micheal Van de Poppe notes that the total market capitalization for crypto is currently holding above the crucial 200-Week MA and EMA levels. These levels are important support that must hold to give way to the next impulse upward. However, if this support fails, Van de Poppe sees a decline in Bitcoins value to $20k. The total market capitalization for #Crypto is still acting above the 200-Week MA and EMA.Important support levels beneath us, and should act as one.

Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses. Smart contract blockchains can secure ownership of digital assets, so these networks play a crucial role in building out the metaverse.

The move higher by the top cryptos, which saw Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rising 1%, came as Ethereum and Bitcoin met the apex of triangle patterns, which Benzinga called out on Friday. Ethereum and Bitcoin also appeared to be ignoring the slightly negative market sentiment amid intensifying discussions on how to avert a debt ceiling crisis, which has a deadline of June 1 fast approaching. Gold was also trading positively, rising about 0.35% higher, which could be an indication that traders are anticipating a recession later this year. From a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum broke up from the triangle on higher-than-average volume, which suggests the pattern was recognized, and a long-term uptrend could be on the horizon.

The Ethereum Chart: When Ethereum popped higher on Tuesday, the crypto almost reached the 50-day simple moving average and was rejected from the area. Now that Ethereum has broken abovethe triangle, bullish traders will want to see the crypto confirm a new uptrend by eventually printing a higher low above Mondays low of $1,791. If Ethereum closes Tuesdays session under the $1,860 mark, the crypto will print a shooting star candlestick, which could indicate lower prices are on the horizon for Wednesday. If that happens, Ethereum could fall to backtest the upper descending trend line of the triangle and reverse course there, which would be bullish. If Ethereum drops back under the upper trend line, the area could continue to act as resistance and push Ethereum lower, suggesting the break abovethe triangle was a bull trap. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,846 and $1,957 and support below at $1,717 and $1,564. Read Next:Binance's Billion-Dollar Blunder?

The collection consists of over 97,000 plots of land  at the current moment each plot Land parcels are 16m x 16m, or 52 square feet. Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses. Smart contract blockchains can secure ownership of digital assets, so these networks play a crucial role in building out the metaverse.

Bitcoin did not get any favor from SEC Gensler earlier in the week, just the standard comments on how rules are already in place. The regulatory question remains the key for the cryptoverse and traders will have to remain patient,\" said Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA. Crypto trader Tony Vays suggested that the current consolidation of Bitcoin indicates that it is on track to experience an extended bull market. Based on his analysis, Vays believes that Bitcoin is poised to reach noteworthy heights, with a potential value of up to $300,000. \"We continue to consolidate. Its continued to be frustrating. I've been a Bitcoiner, and it's very, very clear that Bitcoin is choosing the purple path.I have two paths for Bitcoin. One was a little more bullish with a lower top ($200,000), and the other was a little more bearish with a higher top ($300,000) a little further down in time.\" Crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe has identified a Classic Choppy Pattern on Bitcoin. He said currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a rejection at $27,200 and consolidating, with the CME gap hovering around $26,900. Van de Poppe suggests that Bitcoin needs to break and flip $27,200 in order to generate sustained momentum. Furthermore, if the price falls, there is a strong support level around $26,000-$26,500.

The cryptocurrency sector has entered into another consolidation phase, not offering the usual volatility experienced traders and investors in the space have come to expect. Lower-than-average volume in the sector is to blame, with traders seemingly taking a break from buying and selling cryptos as the market moves into a lull, perhaps caused by the sell in May, go away theory that often holds some truth. Periods of higher volatility are still likely, however, and that may take place for at least a short period of time when the three cryptos break up or down from the triangle patterns they have settled into. Regardless, traders and investors will be watching the crypto sector over the weekend for clues as to how the S&P 500 may behave next week and if Bitcoin, in particular, continues to consolidate, there may be no surprises for the stock market next week.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum Chart: Bitcoin and Ethereum both began trading in triangle patterns on May 12, making a consistent series of lower highs and higher lows. Both cryptos are set to meet the apex of their triangle on May 23, and traders and investors can watch for big bullish or bearish volume to come in when they breach the upper or lower trend line of the pattern to confirm it was recognized. On Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum were forming inside bar patterns, withall of their price action taking place within Thursdays range. The pattern is neutral in this case, but Ethereums inside bar is slightly more bullish than Bitcoin's. Both cryptos are being held down by the eight-day exponential moving average on the daily chart, but if Bitcoin and Ethereum break up from their triangle patterns, they will regain that level, which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward. Bitcoin has resistance above at $27,133 and $28,690 and support below at $25,772 and $25,288. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,846 and $1,957 and support below at $1,717 and $1,554. The Dogecoin Chart: Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is trading in a triangle pattern, set to meet the apex on May 22. The Shiba Inu-themed crypto is also trading in an inside bar pattern, which leans neutral. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is trending under the 200-day simple moving average, which is bearish. If the crypto breaks up from the triangle formation, Dogecoin is likely to find resistance at that indicator. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at 7 cents and at $0.065.

He expressed this sentiment during a discussion at the ongoingBitcoin 2023 Conference in Miami Beach. Van Eck said, \"There's simply no likelihood,\" referring to the ongoing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Grayscale Investments. Grayscale, a significant asset manager, is seeking to morph its Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) trust into an ETF. However, Van Eck is skeptical, suggesting that even if the SEC were to lose the lawsuit, the commission might continue to delay the process, thereby stalling the introduction of a Bitcoin-spot ETF in the next 18 months. Furthermore, Van Eck brought attention to recent filings from competing ETF companies for Ether (CRYPTO: ETH)-futures-based funds, noting that at least three of them had to be modified or withdrawn shortly after their initial submission. He believes this to be indicative of future foot-dragging from the SEC, saying, \"They have a variety of regulatory tools at their disposal.\" Also Read:Hong Kong-Based Hashkey's Billion-Dollar Dream: The Next Big Bang In Crypto The crypto industry has been vying for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. for some time, but regulators have shown a great deal of reluctance to grant approval.

However, Bitcoin-futures funds have been trading since 2021, and many of the potential issues that were previously flagged have since been resolved. VanEck manages several ETFs and has made strides in the crypto space. In 2021, it introduced the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BATS:XBTF) which is based on Bitcoin futures. However, a proposal by VanEck for an ETF that would directly hold Bitcoin was turned down by the SEC at the end of the same year.

The collection consists of over 97,000 plots of land  at the current moment each plot Land parcels are 16m x 16m, or 52 square feet. Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses. Smart contract blockchains can secure ownership of digital assets, so these networks play a crucial role in building out the metaverse.

Vee said he always had visions of what his conference would look like. The entrepreneur was influenced by South by Southwest and smaller business conferences. Vee called VeeCon a business conference layered with a lot of pop culture. VeeCon 2023 will also feature a VeeFriends Museum, GaryVee Garage Sale with collectibles for sale, and an art gallery featuring 25 artists in Web3 and NFT Land, which hosts 13 NFT projects with interactive elements. Sponsors of the event will also have interactive exhibits and ways to engage with fans and new potential customers.

Vee Highlights Speakers to Watch: Benzinga asked Vee to point out the one speaker from VeeCon 2022 that had to be asked back this year. Feedback was Jesse Itzler, he absolutely annihilated last year, Vee told Benzinga. Benzinga also asked Vee which speakers at VeeCon 2023 are perhaps going under the radar and will be loved by the community at this years event. Vee highlighted Vox Media co-founder and CEO Jim Bankoff. I think that will capture a lot of attention, Vee said. Vee also highlighted Lauren Fritts as a lot of people know the WeWork company and someone who can navigate the brand. Matt Van Horn, the co-founder of smart oven company June and ride-sharing company Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), was another individual named by Vee. Rachel Webber from Playboy was another key speaker to watch, according to Vee. Shes the type of person that will say one thing at the conference that changes someones perspective. An athlete at VeeCon 2023 that Vee hopes surprises people is UFC fighter Michelle Waterson Gomez. I think shes got a real story to tell. On the NFT artist side of things, Vee singled out OSF. OSF is an incredible artist in Web3. Vee said a big question in the NFT space is who will be the Jackson Pollock or Andy Warhol of the next 20 years. Vee said that OSF is someone he would roll the dice on. What Benzinga Is Looking Forward To: Among the key speakers that Benzinga is looking forward to at VeeCon 2023 include Patrick Harris, Barrymore, Alba and John. On the sports side of things, panels will feature Ed Reed, Barron Davis, Aliyah Boston and Javier Chicharito Hernandez.

Moreover, Tate stated that he has no affiliation with any cryptos because he believes that for someone to profit from cryptocurrency, someone else must lose. \"I dont want anybody who is associated with me to lose.\" Tate also claimed that he could single-handedly inflate the value of a cryptocurrency by millions, but he has no interest in doing so. \"I could pump a s**t coin and make it $100 million, but I dont need it because I already have $100 million,\" he adds.

What Happened: It seems that other states may follow in his footsteps. Here's a look at all states opposing CBDC. Texas lawmakers have drafted a bill called Expressing opposition to the creation of a central bank digital currency (Texas Senate Concurrent Resolution 25), which argues that a digital dollar could lead to increased levels of \"government surveillance and control over private cash holdings and transactions.\" The Louisiana Legislature has raised concerns about privacy, stating that the technology \"raises significant concerns over the privacy of individuals and businesses in Louisiana.\" North Dakotas proposed bill, The adoption of a Central Bank Digital Currency in the United States, warns that implementing a CBDC would grant the Federal Reserve unprecedented control over the North Dakota peoples \"lives, freedoms, choices, and sovereignty.\" Alabamas bill is similar to the Florida law. It is currently under review and would prevent state or government local agencies from using CBDCs. See More:The Art Of The Future: Lisa Rays TheUpsideSpace Bring NFTs To Center Stage Why It Matters: DeSantis on May 13 signed a Senate bill to prohibit the use of a federally-adopted central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The legislation I signed today makes Florida the first state in the nation to protect individuals from government surveillance in their personal finances through a CBDC, DeSantis said on Twitter. CBDCs are digital currencies issued by central banks and backed by government guarantees.

However, PEPE, another crypto token born out of meme culture, hasnt quite made it to that level yet. Despite hitting a peak daily trading volume of $2 billion in the past few weeks, this pales in comparison to SHIB and DOGE, which achieved trading volumes of $40 billion and $70 billion respectively. The report goes on to reveal that unlike DOGE and SHIB, retail participation in the Pepe rally has been nearly nonexistent.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The recommendation comes as regulators become increasingly vocal about the substantial risks these digital assets could pose to consumers. What Happened: Members of Parliament are worried that treating consumer crypto trading as a financial service could mislead consumers into thinking that the activity is safe and protected. The cross-party committee argues that the nature of such trading more closely aligns with gambling and should be regulated accordingly.

Bitget managing director Gracy Chen told Benzinga that theSeychelles-based crypto exchange believes in the potential of cryptocurrency to drive financial innovation and economic growth. It urgedcollaboration between the government and the industry to shape a regulatory environment that safeguards consumers, combats illicit activities, fosters innovation, and promotes the sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency industry. \"Bitget is committed to embracing regulation and implementing a comprehensive set of stringent risk control and anti-money laundering policies and procedures,\" she said. It goes on to assert that consumer speculation in non-backed crypto-assets is more akin to gambling than a financial service. With the surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) during the pandemic, the number of DIY investors participating in cryptocurrency trading has increased significantly. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data indicates that around 6 million UK residents own or have owned crypto-assets. Harriet Baldwin MP, chair of the committee, expressed her concern about the hazards posed by the largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry. \"The events of 2022 have shed light on the risks consumers face in the crypto-asset sector, a substantial portion of which remains unregulated,\" she stated. \"There is a pressing need for effective regulation to safeguard consumers and encourage valuable innovation in the UK's financial services sector.\" The committee also recommended that the government adopt a balanced approach to developing crypto-asset technologies and refrain from investing public resources in crypto-asset activities without a clear, beneficial use case. Plans for a digital 'Britcoin', a central bank-backed digital pound issued by the Bank of England, remain on the table, despite the government's decision to abandon its plans to produce a non-fungible token through the Royal Mint.

However, the poll indicates that Bidens lead may be shaky should the situation at the US southern border worsen.

The same goes for any rise in ETH/BTC or bounces in altcoins, as they will probably end up being sold for Bitcoin.  Credible Crypto suggests this is because \"BTC is prepping for its next leg up and there simply isn't enough liquidity to go around. For the next few weeks, every alt pump is a trap. Every rise in ETH/BTC is a trap. Every bounce on alts will likely be sold into, for Bitcoin. Why?Because $BTC is prepping for it's next leg up and there simply isn't enough liquidity to go around. More on this below  https://t.co/ZJi3BYAsdE CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) May 16, 2023 Mark Yusko, Founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Digital, has reaffirmed his prediction of an impending digital asset bull market. During a recent interview with Blockworks Macro, Yusko admitted that his original forecast of a bull market beginning in April was a bit hasty. Instead, he believes that a surge in the crypto market, or what he calls crypto summer, will take place in mid-June. According to Yusko, Bitcoin is now in a position to ignite a big breakout as it prints a technical reversal pattern. \"And if you look at the chart, it's like a beautiful inverse head and shoulders at $27,000. And so, it's a really interesting technical pattern. And you know, I think we need to see some good news to get the momentum going.\" Crypto analyst Justin Bennett said that we can expect a correction in the near future as a result of numerous long liquidations in the ETH market. Bennett suggests that the thick resistance levels may lead to a drop in price, potentially landing in the range of $1,450-$1,500.

What Happened: Coinbase petitioned a federal court in April to require the SEC to issue clear guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges and companies. The SEC has responded, stating that Coinbase does not have the right to mandamus, which is a court order that obligates a government agency to fulfill specific duties. Perhaps recognizing this, Coinbase instead asserts that this Court should compel the Commission to act on Coinbase's recently filed rulemaking petition.

Data from Kaiko, a leading analytics firm, revealedthe rolling 30-day correlation of Bitcoin and Ethereum recently descended to approximately 78%. In simple terms, correlation quantifiedhow the prices of two assets moved in tandem. A lower correlation implied the prices of these assets were diverging more frequently, suggesting the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum were no longer as tightly linked as they previously were. Several elements could be contributing to this alteration in correlation. A study by Coinbase found the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum started to decline from mid-to-late March, with Bitcoin outshining other cryptocurrencies amidst theU.S. banking sector upheaval and increased regulatory focus on non-Bitcoin digital assets.

Noting this pattern, Coinbase suggested market volatility and investor behavior could be among the driving forces. In theory, a declining correlation between two assets bolsteredthe argument for portfolio diversification. Investors holding both Bitcoin and Ethereum might stand to gain from this lower correlation, as it could potentially mitigate overall portfolio risk. Additionally, this decoupling could signal these cryptocurrencies are carving out independent paths, opening up new avenues for investors to capitalize on their differing performances.

I think a regulatory framework will be an important discussion in the space for the upcoming few years, at least five years, she added. Asked if Bitget was impacted over the last year amid a crypto winter,\" Chensaid a cryptowinter is the best season because it isa golden window for growth. She added that, during a bull market, if a company is doing something well, everyone can see it.However, it is only during a bear market that people tend to leave rather than build, she added. In the last year, Bitget has grown from 10th in exchange ranking, to the top five. We have a clear goal. We want to continue to serve more and more users and become a top-three crypto exchange in terms of trading volume in the next three to fiveyears. So I think more visits to our platform is a good start. And also building a stronger ecosystem is another important stepwe are taking towards that, she said. Also Read:Massive Shiba Inu Endorsement?

So we want to tap into the potential of the Asian market, home to a growing number of crypto users and innovators, she noted.

Now, a lot of countries across the world are embracing crypto and blockchain technology. The hub now is shifting from the US to everywhere globally. In Asia, there is a lot of growth in countries like India, China (including Hong Kong), Korea, and the Philippines, and there are lots of major players in the crypto industry, she said. In Europe, governments are alsotaking a proactive approach inthe industry, she added. Asked if the SECs approach towards the crypto industry is driving out growth, Chen admitted, It does have an effect. When asked which citiescould be the next cryptocurrency hub if anti-crypto policies were to drive U.S.-based companies toward other markets, Chen saidHong Kong, Singapore,Dubai, London, and Parisin Europecould bepoised to see tremendous growth, especially ifentities shift theirbase there.

What Happened: According to a Sunday report by The Financial Times, the company is reportedly in advanced talks to raise $100 million ahead of the launch of the digital currency, which aims to use eyeball-scanning technology to create a worldwide identification system for accessing cryptocurrency. Altman founded Worldcoin in 2019 with Alex Blania, and earlier this month the company debuted a digital wallet designed for the Worldcoin ecosystem. Known as the World App, the digital wallet is intended to expand the availability of digital identity and global finance, and can be used to authenticate with World ID, obtain Worldcoin tokens, and send digital money anywhere. Worldcoins unique approach to identifying users involves using iris scanning technology to ensure that each user is a human and not a bot or automated system. To achieve this, users look into a small orb-shaped device that captures their iris pattern and converts it into a biometric scanning code, which becomes their proof of personhood.

Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin broke down bearishly from a triangle pattern on May 8, which set the crypto into a downtrend. Bitcoins most recent lower high within the trend was formed on Wednesday at $28,334 and the most recent lower low was printed at the $27,279 mark on Monday. On Thursday, Bitcoin printed a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which suggested lower prices would come during Fridays trading session. If the crypto closes near its low-of-day, Bitcoin will print a second consecutive bearish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come again on Saturday. Bullish traders want to see the crypto eventually form a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, which could indicate a bounce is in the cards, at least to form another lower high. Bitcoin has resistance above at $27,113 and $28,690 and support below at $25,772 and $25,288. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum entered a downtrend on May 6 and printed a lower high on Wednesday at $1,888 and a lower low at the $1,810 mark on May 8. On Friday, Ethereum was working to print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate the next lower low has occurred and the crypto will trade higher on Satuday. Ethereums lower-than-average volume on Friday also indicates a bounce is on the horizon because the bears are becoming tired. If the bulls gain momentum and push Ethereum up over the 50-day simple moving average, it could indicate a trend reversal is in the cards. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,846 and $1,957 and support below at $1,717 and $1,564. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin confirmed a new downtrend on Wednesday, when the crypto printed a lower high of $0.074 and the most recent confirmed lower low was formed at the 7-cent mark on Monday. During Fridays 24-hour trading session, Dogecoin was working to print an inside bar pattern, with all of its price action taking place within Thursdays trading range. The pattern leans bearish in this case, but traders can watch for the crypto to break up or down from Thursdays mother bar on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction. Like Ethereum, Dogecoin was working to print a hammer candlestick on Friday, which suggests the local bottom may have occurred. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at $0.07 and at $0.065.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Data provided by Glassnode", "Raising concerns over the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) handling of the digital asset landscape, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a major business interest group, is voicing criticism on behalf of digital asset detractors. The regulatory approach towards entities likeCoinbase Global Inc(NASDAQ:COIN), and Kraken is on the firing line. The business group has publicly backed Coinbase in its legal tussle with the SEC concerning a request for rules specific to cryptocurrencies, The Block reported. In an unusual legal move, Coinbase filed a writ of mandamus lawsuit against the SEC last month. This action was a follow-up to a call made in the previous summer for the introduction of digital asset-specific rules. In its court submission supporting Coinbase's suit, the Chamber statedthat the SEC's non-responsiveness to Coinbase's appeal \"is causing significant financial harm to both Coinbase and the wider business community.\" The Chamber has also taken issue with the SEC's enforcement action against Kraken's staking-as-a-service venture. Despite Kraken reaching a settlement and subsequently discontinuing this service within the U.S., the Chamber identifies this as symptomatic of an aggressive SEC enforcement strategy that might push more digital asset enterprises to stop their U.S. services. Also Read:Binance.US Shakeup: Is CFTC Lawsuit Pushing Out Founder Changpeng Zhao? The group has also expressed frustration over the lack of clarity surrounding Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. The SEC Chair Gary Gensler's approach to Ether contrasts with that of his predecessor, Jay Clayton, and this has increased the uncertainty. While the SEC under Clayton suggested that Ether might be so decentralized as to no longer qualify as a financial security, Gensler has indicated otherwise, although he stopped short of giving a clear opinion during a recent congressional appearance. The Chamber's filing states, \"Ether, with a market cap exceeding $220 billion and playing a crucial role in the industry, has been around for almost a decade. But, despite the prevalence of Ether, there is no consensus among regulators about its nature.\" The filing spotlights the SEC's shifting perspective on Ether, the disagreement between the SEC and the CFTC on the digital asset, and Gensler's recent ambiguous responses to Congress and journalists about Ether's classification as a security or otherwise. The Chamber's amicus brief, submitted earlier this week, also reflects an argument made by Coinbase in its own lawsuit. It implies that the SEC has already reached a conclusion about whether to issue a rule but decided against formally responding to the request, as indicated by Gensler's public comments that existing financial market laws suffice for digital asset regulation. Coinbase has the option to contest the SEC's decision in court, a process that could take a significant amount of time. However, the company has chosen to take a proactive stance, initiating a lawsuit against the SEC now, to confront the issue on its own terms, rather than await the outcome of a possible investigation into several of its business operations that could lead to enforcement action.

Shiba Inus lower prices are taking place within a triple inside bar pattern. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend. An inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\" A double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge!

The Shiba Inu Chart: Shiba Inus inside bar pattern leans bearish because the crypto has been trending lower, but traders and investors can watch for Shiba Inu to eventually break up or down from Mondays mother bar to indicate future direction. Although Shiba Inus trading pattern leans bearish, upward movement in the apex cryptos could cause the pattern to negate, if Shiba Inu decides to follow suit.

Lisa Ray, the multi-faceted personality renowned for her contribution to the entertainment industry, modelling, and philanthropy, has added another feather to her cap. Her latest endeavour, TheUpsideSpace, is a pioneering and curator-led platform that focuses on promoting digital art and the innovative technology of NFTs. Ray, 51-years-old, co-founded TheUpsideSpace alongside Singapore-based art collector and philanthropist Ayesha Khan. The two met during the early days of the pandemic in Singapore and shared a desire to make contemporary regional art more accessible to a wider audience and to modernize the art world while harnessing the potential of Web3 technology. The platform was launched with the mission of bringing forth a new generation of artists from South, East, and West Asia. Opening Gateway To Artists She believes that the primary goal of TheUpsideSpace is to offer all artists, including digital artists, access to technology. \"We work with diverse artists, including digital artists who are, in some cases, digital natives. Our exhibits vary in content and approach, delighting in the diversity of expression.\" This digital artwork is an AI-Assisted artwork. Here, the journey of rebirth begins, inviting you to shed the old and embrace the new, to transform and evolve into a new form of being. This artwork is from the series REBORN. (Photo: TheUpsideSpace) TheUpsideSpace comprises an online art lab, a creator studio, and an inclusive community for discovery and discourse. It serves as a platform for both traditional visual artists who are new to NFTs and new media artists who want to expand the reach of their experimental art. \"We launched in December and managed to hold five digital exhibitions that were very effective in promoting young artists in different regions. This has become our de facto launch pad, even though we are primarily a digital arts platform, Ray tells Benzinga India. NFTs  The Game Changer For Ray, the introduction of NFTs has transformed the art world, providing benefits to both artists and collectors, such as authenticity, provenance, and collecting solutions. \"With NFTs, you get transparency and direct communication with artists, which is not encouraged in the traditional art world. Traditional art purchases involve a lot of hoops to jump through, making it an arduous process,\" said Ray. She explains that every period, movement, and disruption is initially met with resistance, which shows that innovation and progress are being made. For example, the invention of paint tubes enabled artists to paint on-site, which led to the Impressionist movement. Today, these paintings are worth millions of dollars and are viewed in museums and institutions, but when they were first introduced, they were met with resistance. However, every period, movement, and disruption is initially met with resistance, which is a healthy indicator that you're onto something. See More: Top Indian Apps That Give Bitcoin, NFT Rewards The UpsideSpace is geographically agnostic and not necessarily targeting specific geographic regions. We are planning a phygital exhibition in New York in September to engage diasporic communities interested in the art movements happening in their homelands. We have many different strands of thought driving our platform.\" Not Everyones Cup Of Tea Ray faces a significant challenge in navigating the divide between two distinct NFT buyer demographics: those who view NFTs as stock market investments, and those who appreciate NFTs as fine art. This issue has made it difficult to effectively articulate the nature and intricacies of TheUpsideSpace's platform to both traditional and web 3.0 collectors, oftentimes leading to confusion. In responding to the concerns about the environmental impact of NFTs, she noted that from the outset, the team at TheUpsideSpace engaged in debates about the blockchain technology most suitable.Ultimately, they opted for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain, which implemented Proof of Stake and thus became more environmentally friendly. Unafraid of the repulsive and controversial, the subjects in Soikas artworks are derived and signified with a sense of humour, juxtaposed with the serious reality of death, environmental destruction and self-deprecation, with a pornographic outlook. Hailing from the Philippines, he uses the iconic Jollibee logo as a symbol for the masses.

BRC-20 Tokens Eyeing $1B Market Cap The BRC-20 token standard, an equivalent to Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, has experienced rapid growth on the Bitcoin blockchain, with its market cap fast approaching $1 billion. The Ordinals protocol enables the creation of fungible tokens, resulting in a total of 14,079 different tokens minted using the BRC-20 standard.\r\nUnlike Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, which rely on smart contracts, BRC-20 tokens require a Bitcoin wallet for minting and trading. This simplified approach has contributed to the increasing popularity of these tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The recent meme coin frenzy has played a significant role in driving up transaction fees for miners. As the market cap of BRC-20 tokens inches closer to the $1 billion milestone, it showcases the growing interest and potential for token standards on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordi meme coin has emerged as the leading BRC-20 token, boasting a fully diluted market cap exceeding $525 million, according to data from brc-20.io and Ordspace. This surge comes after the token's value skyrocketed by 22,500% to $25, up from $0.11 at the start of April, fueled by the ongoing meme coin craze. With a token supply of 21 million, Ordi became available for trading on Gate.io today, marking the first centralized crypto exchange to list the top BRC-20 token. In the BRC-20 market segment, Ordi is followed by other Bitcoin-based meme assets like Meme, Domo, and Nals, which have individual market caps ranging between $8 million and $20 million. Exploring the Ordinals Protocol on Bitcoin The Ordinals protocol enables developers to assign a unique identity or file to each satoshi within the Bitcoin network through a process called inscription. This mechanism paved the way for the creation of both fungible tokens, like BRC-20 tokens, which are interchangeable, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that often feature digital art.

A bill is being proposed to give the New York Department of Financial Services more crypto authority, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Crypto trader Michael Van De Poppe sees the apex crypto dropping back to $28,400 levels. He also suggests that during choppy market conditions, trading PEPE may be more favorable than BTC. According to Van De Poppe, the key to upper momentum lies in reclaiming $29,200. While $28,400 presents a good mid-range option, he is not interested in it for the time being. And we fell right through it for #Bitcoin.Unfortunate, back to $28,400.Choppy areas, through which trading $PEPE makes more sense than $BTC at this point.Reclaim $29.2K is needed for upper momentum, $28.4K is a good one, but not interested mid-range. pic.twitter.com/IWRE20ya7t Michal van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 6, 2023 Santiments latest data reveals that Ethereum has reached 20,000 active deposits, marking a significant milestone since November 2021. This surge in activity can be attributed to traders moving their profits from Pepe (PEPE)  a meme coin that has been garnering a lot of attention lately  to ETH. \"Exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021. As expected, ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2,000 once again.\" In a recent video update, acclaimed crypto analyst Jason Pizzino appears bullish on the future of Bitcoin. Pizzino highlights that both Bitcoin and the stock market have shown resilience against negative economic news. Despite looming threats of a recession and banking collapses, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its strong momentum. \"For nearly two months, Bitcoin has been trading over $25,000. With all of the bad news that we have seen in the markets, nothing is swaying Bitcoin from hitting $30,000, $40,000, maybe even $50,000 this year,\" he said.

Ethereum Price Action: Ethereum, the second-biggest crypto, has been on a broad uptrend since it bottomed under $1,100 in Nov. 2022. The upward momentum was temporarily muted, as financial assets teetered amid economic and political uncertainties. On June 18, 2022, Ethereum hit a low of $896.11 before staging a comeback. The peak-trough pullback between that low and the crypto's all-time high of $4,718.04 (which was reached on Nov. 9, 2021) was about 80%. With the rally beginning Friday, Ethereum has managed to break out of a consolidation phase seen since late April. At last check, Ethereum traded 1.35% higher at $1,933.04, according to Benzinga Pro data. See Also: How To Buy Ethereum (ETH) What's Behind Ethereum's Outperformance: Ethereum has been getting a lift in recent sessions thanks to the successful implementation of the Shanghai and Capella Hard Fork. These upgrades are expected to improve the crypto's Mainnet performance, a testament to the fact that the blockchain has been fully tested, developed, deployed and running on its own technology and protocol. The upgrades are also expected to improve the blockchain's security layers and energy efficiency. More importantly, they could help lower the gas fees associated with the operation of layer-2 solutions running on top of Ethereum. Return From Ethereum: A $1,000 invested in Ethereum at the 2018 closing price of $133.37 would have fetched 7.5 Ethereum.

Heres what to watch on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin over the weekend: Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been making a series of lower highs and higher lows, which has settled the crypto into a triangle pattern on the daily chart. The crypto is set to meet the apex of the triangle on May 14 and traders can watch for Bitcoin to eventually break up or down from the pattern on higher-than-average volume to indicate a future direction, although the pattern leans bullish. The 50-day simple moving average has been acting as support and guiding Bitcoin higher since March 13. Over the last five days, Bitcoin has dropped to test the area as support and bounce. This suggests that if Bitcoin falls under the 50-day, it could be a good place to stop out a bullish trade. Bitcoin has resistance above at $30,050 and $31.418 and support below at $28,690 and $27,133. The Ethereum Chart: When Ethereum burst higher during Fridays 24-hour trading session, it formed a higher high to confirm a new uptrend. The most recent higher low was formed on May 1 at $1,805 and on Friday, Ethereum traded above the lower high of $1,939. If Ethereum closes the trading session near its high-of-day price, the crypto will print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday. The second most likely scneario is that the crypto will trade sideways to form an inside bar to consolidate. Ethereum has resistance above at $2,150 and $2,317 and support below at $1,957 and $1,846. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin has been trading mostly sideways under the 200-day simple moving average since April 22, showing no clear trend. The move has come on lower-than-average volume, which indicates a current lack of interest in the crypto. Bullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Dogecoin up above the 200-day SMA, which could indicate a bull cycle is on the horizon. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and throw Dogecoin into a confirmed downtrend. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and $0.091 and support below at $0.075 and at 7 cents.

YCharts data indicates that the average Bitcoin transaction fee peaked at $7.20. The ongoing memecoin trading craze, featuring coins like Pepe Coin (CRYPTO: PEPE), has inadvertently pushed Bitcoin's transaction costs to multi-year highs. The current spike in Bitcoin transaction fees is mainly due to a surge in the activity involving BRC-20 transactions. Galaxy Research data shows, on May 2, BRC-20 transactions accounted for 50% of all Bitcoin transactions. The BRC-20 token standard, an experimental standard inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20, enables users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transaction fees on the #Bitcoin network yesterday reached their highest point in 2 years, both by mean sats/vbyte per transaction in daily cumulative fees paid. Half of all transactions yesterday related to BRC-20 transactions.  pic.twitter.com/J8geOOxwlM\r\n Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) May 3, 2023 Introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst named Domo, BRC-20 has quickly become a significant trend in the crypto industry, particularly amid the rapid growth of the PEPE memecoin. Over the past week, the token's value has surged more than 600%, reaching an all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5. Also Read:Coinbase Turns To AI For Unstoppable Crypto Domination: Here's What You Need To Know The Bitcoin blockchain isn't the only one affected by the memecoin frenzy. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain gas fees have also recently skyrocketed to new multi-month highs. On May 2, ETH transaction fees reached an aggregate amount of over $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. Ethereum remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees as of this writing. Nevertheless, the current spike in Bitcoin transaction fees is still far from the all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees occurred in April 2021, when the average Bitcoin transaction cost nearly hit $70 due to a significant decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. Transaction fees reached their previous peak in 2017, surging above $60. Read Next:Crypto ATMs On Chopping Block With UK Financial Watchdog's Relentless Pursuit Against Money Laundering", "The Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) network has recently been confronted with a worrying issue for its users  the escalating gas consumption rates on the platform. Gas fees, which are levied for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, have been increasing at an unsettling pace. Data scientist Hildobby shared information from Dune, revealing that the median ETH gas price, measured in gwei and averaged over a week, reached 87. This peak hasn't been seen in the past year  since May 2022. The average transaction fee is now around $50, a marked rise from just a few months ago, when it was below $10. High gas fees have led to user dissatisfaction, as even straightforward transactions have become progressively more expensive. Many users, such as dApp developers, traders, and retail investors, are finding it challenging to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem due to exorbitant gas fees. The primary cause of this issue is the surging demand for transaction processing on the network, driven by the re-emergence of memecoins in the market after nearly two years of silence. In recent weeks, memecoin trading has accelerated, with the majority of activity taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. PEPE, a memecoin whose market cap topped $1 billionin the two weeks following its mid-April launch, serves as an example. Also Read:Israeli Authorities Uncover Binance Accounts Tied To ISIS, Hamas Group Other memecoins that have experienced substantial hype include ArbDogeAI (AIDOGE), WOJAK (CRYPTO: WOJAK), andAiShiba (CRYPTO: SHIBAI). Another contributing factor to elevated ETH gas fees is the resurgence of NFT trading on the Ethereum blockchain. While trading volumes fell significantly in April,reports indicate they reached $4.7 billion in Q1 2023, a 137% increase from the previous year. Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence platform, disclosed that gas consumption for NFT-related activities on Ethereum rose by 94% between January and February. The Ethereum community is diligently working on solutions to alleviate this problem, such as the introduction of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. The proposal aims to decrease gas fees and transaction throughput by incorporating a new transaction type that accepts \"blobs\" of data. In the interim, users have had to adapt their strategies. Some have chosen to execute transactions during off-peak hours when gas fees are usually lower, while others have migrated to alternative blockchain networks with lower fees or adopted layer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC) to cut transaction costs.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

(NASDAQ:COIN) is diversifying its business by launching an international derivatives exchange for institutional crypto traders outside the United States. The Coinbase International Exchange will list Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) perpetual futures starting this week, after receiving a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority in April. The San Francisco-based company is entering a market largely occupied by offshore players such as Binance (CRYPTO: BNB) and the now-collapsed FTX (CRYPTO: FTT). Coinbase is grappling with legal uncertainty in the U.S., as it received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, indicating potential legal action. Also Read:CoinMarketCap's 'Killer Whales': The Shark Tank Of Web3 And NFT Entrepreneurship A company spokesperson told Bloomberg, \"Coinbase continues to await approval to be able to offer futures directly to our customers in the U.S.\" Initially, the international exchange in Bermuda will only be available to non-US institutional clients. Perpetual futures, popular among crypto traders for hedging or speculating on the price of underlying tokens using leverage, don't have an expiration date. Coinbase International Exchange will initially offer up to five times leverage, and all trading will be settled in USD Coin, the stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Financial Ltd. (CRYPTO: USDC), a Coinbase partner. In a blog post, Coinbase stated its commitment to the U.S. market but expressed disappointment in the country's \"regulation by enforcement\" approach. The company derived 84% of its revenue from the U.S. last year. Some earlier attempts at global expansion, such as operations in Japan, faced challenges and were eventually shut down.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.

Currently, the combined market capitalization of over 8,800 BRC-20 tokens stands at $137 million  a remarkable 682% increase from $17.5 million just a week ago, as per data monitored by Ordinals-builder Ordspace, Coindesk reported. The BRC-20 token standard was developed in early March by an anonymous on-chain analyst named Domo. The goal was to enable the issuance and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. This innovative approach came shortly after the launch of the Ordinals Protocol, which permits users to embed digital art references within small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dynamo DeFi, a pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer, commented in their weekly newsletter, \"Ordinals on Bitcoin have had unintentional consequences. One of these is the invention of the BRC-20 fungible token standard. Its now possible to create fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Since inception, BRC-20s have accounted for nearly 6% of all Bitcoin activity.\" Also Read:Get Ready For Change: US Government To Ready Crypto Regulations Although BRC-20 may sound similar to the popular ERC-20 standard, they are distinct, with the former lacking the ability to interact with smart contracts. The ERC-20 is a technical standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain, which is well-known for its smart contract capabilities. Crypto exchange Binance clarified in an explainer, \"This [BRC-20] is not a token standard like youre accustomed to with EVM chains, which create smart contracts that manage the token standard and its various rules. Instead, its simply a way to store a script file in Bitcoin and use it to attribute tokens to satoshis and then allow them to be transferred between users.\" The majority of active BRC-20 tokens are classified as meme coins  cryptocurrencies derived from internet memes or humorous features. As of now, the top three coins created using the BRC-20 standard are ORDI, OG, and PEPE. According to Mark Jeffrey from Boolean Fund, the introduction of BRC-20 tokens has rendered crypto exchanges unnecessary.

Gemini (@Gemini) April 30, 2023 Gemini expressed its support for the mediation process, but also expressed frustration with the pace of progress in Genesis restructuring efforts. Gemini allows users to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), etc. Why It Matters: This comes as Gemini, on April 11, reportedly received a $100 million loan from its co-founders, Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. The loan was made after Gemini failed to secure funding from outside investors. The Winklevoss brothers set up the exchange back in 2015. Tyler Winklevoss currently serves as the CEO of the company, with Cameron serving as its president. Gemini has been impacted by a series of events last year. In November 2022, the company halted withdrawals for its Earn product in collaboration with Genesis, after the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Eventually, the service was discontinued entirely and the process of returning funds to users is still ongoing.

One trader turned an investment of around oneEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH), or around $2,000 into $140,000. What Happened: Over the last two weeks, one of the top trending cryptocurrencies has been Pepe (CRYPTO: PEPE). Reports have surfaced that investors taking hundreds or thousands of dollars and turning thatinto hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Benzinga spoke to one of the traders who was once among the largest Pepe holders to find out how everything went down. A trader, who wished to remain anonymous, told Benzinga they started trading cryptocurrency during the Covid phase. Im in a sales job and it was pretty slow when they shut everything down, the trader said. Trading started with buying Ethereum at around $1,000 and getting into non-fungible tokens fairly early. Kind of just went down the rabbit hole. Among the big wins in NFTs for the trader was minting 5 Azukis, one of the hottest NFT projects of 2022. As NFTs and cryptocurrenciesfaced setbacks, the trader sold the majority of their positions, paid taxes, and had been waiting for the next thing to invest in. \"Lost my a** like everyone else, just trying to buy stuff I think is undervalued.\" Enter PEPE The trader told Benzinga they first heard about Pepe on Twitter, with the account DegenHarambe posting about the coin when it was at a market capitalization of around $20,000. The trader said that with \"sh*tcoins\" you typically want to be one of the first 100 holders, otherwise you might be used as exit liquidity for others. You also need some form of risk. Just like anybody in the space, I think you have to have some degree of degenerate gambling problems. The trader put one Ethereum into Pepe for an investment of around $2,000 with the cryptocurrency trading with a market capitalization of between $180,000 to $200,000 on a Friday in April. It wasnt until later in the early hours of that Sundaythat the trader saw how much Pepe had gained. Im at work, go home, meet friends for dinner, dont even look at phone, put kids to sleep. At 3:30 a.m., the trader woke upto feed a newborn baby and saw that their Pepe investment had turned from one ETH into fiveETH. Oh, might have something here. We might have a little lightning in a bottle here, the trader recalled thinking. On Saturday, April 8, the trader was at work and busy and didnt have a chance to look at Pepe very often. When they were able to check, it was revealed that the one ETH was now worth around 10 ETH with the coin trading with a market capitalization of over $1.3 million. On the Sunday andfollowing Monday after the launch, Pepe went even higher and became a trending topic across social media. The trader sold seven to eightETH worth of Pepe on Sunday, money pulled to help cover taxes on the investment and that could also be used to help with a new home purchase and renovation. On Monday, the one ETH investment, plus the eight ETH taken out, was worth around 70 ETH. The trader sold a large amount of the investment on Monday before rebuying back in 7.5 ETH worth. By Tuesday, the 7.5 ETHworth was worth around 30 ETH. At the time of the interview, the trader had around 100 billion Pepe left, which was worth around $20,000 to $22,000. The trader turned the one ETH into around $140,000 counting what was sold and what was currently held. At its peak, the original oneETH invested was worth $1.2 million, but the coin being illiquid made it impossible to sell the full amount without the coin going down significantly. Shortly after selling some Pepe, the trader realized they were the 14th largest holder at one point. You dont want to be the first out, but you dont want to be last. The trader said investing in Pepe was a risk, but one they thought made sense as there wasnt a meme frog coin yet. That was the risk worth it in my head. Related Link: How To Buy Altcoins Whats Next: The trader told Benzinga they would keep investing in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, despite the returns of Pepe being a potential once-in-a-lifetime experience. This stuff doesnt happen often, it never happens. The trader referred to cryptocurrency as the casino that never sleeps. The trader has had several huge hits in the years of investing in cryptocurrency. Along with buying into Pepe and Azuki NFTs early, the trader was also early to Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), investing in the coin on one of its first days. An investment in Shiba Inu gave the trader a 2 ETH gain, but would be worth millions of dollars if they held. My portfolio is probably worth more now than it was during the bull market. The trader said that everyone is looking for a leg up through side jobs and hustling. Cryptos kind of that for me. I like to invest in crypto, because I think the multiples are there. Thats the beauty of the space. For Pepe and other crypto investments, the trader still preaches caution to others. You have to preach caution on this stuff. The trader recalls getting messages from friends and traders as Pepe was rising and thinking it's already up over 40x when it started, why would you buy now? You dont want anyone to lose money. The trader continues to hold a small position in Pepe and hopes it goes up over time. Everyone knows Pepe, probably the oldest meme there is. Hope it becomes something bigger than it is today. The trader wouldnt mention by name any cryptocurrencies or NFTs they were holding, outside of Azukis. As for the future of Pepe and what could be next, the trader shared their final thought. Hopefully it goes higher one day.

The apex cryptocurrency and gold settled into inside bar patterns on the daily chart, whileEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) followed suit, forming the same consolidation pattern. In contrast, the general market was spiking higher, with the S&P 500 climbing about 0.6%. An inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour chart or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar and each is called an \"inside bar.\" A double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin started to rebound on April 26 after forming a rounded-bottom pattern beginning on April 20. On Thursday and Friday, Bitcoin was forming a double inside bar pattern to consolidate the rebound. Traders and investors can watch for the crypto to break up or down from Wednesdays mother bar on higher-than-average volume on the weekend to indicate future direction. The consolidation pattern leans bullish because the crypto was trading higher prior. Bitcoin has resistance above at $31,418 and $35,593 and support below at $28,690 and $25,772. The Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum was working to print a double inside bar pattern on Friday, with the last two days price action taking place within Wednesdays range. Like Bitcoin, Ethereums inside bar lean slightly bullish but traders can watch for a break of the pattern on higher-than-average volume. If Ethereum breaks down from Wednesdays mother bar, bullish traders can watch for the crypto to reverse and bounce up from the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which has been acting as support since April 24. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,957 and $2,150 and support below at $1,846 and $1,717. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin was also printing a double inside bar pattern on Friday and holding above support at the 50-day SMA. If Dogecoin breaks up from the pattern, bullish traders will want to see the crypto regain the 200-day SMA as support. For Dogecoin to regain that level, much more volume will be needed. Dogecoin has been trading on lower-than-average volume recently, which indicates a current lack of interest in the crypto. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and $0.091 and support below at $0.075 and at 7 cents.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Ted Cruz Reveals Why He's A Long-Term Crypto Investor Photo: Shutterstock", "Ethereum has been struggling to break and maintain its position above the $2,000 psychological price level. Despite this struggle, there are positive indicators for Ethereum, including trading above both the weekly and daily 200 simple moving averages (SMA), suggesting a potential bullish trend. The cryptocurrency market has been a rollercoaster ride for investors lately, with prices experiencing volatile ups and downs. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been no exception. Recently, Ethereum has been wrestling with the $2,000 psychological price level, attempting to break up through it and maintain its position above this critical threshold. In the middle of April, Ethereum managed to push past the $2,000 mark, sparking hope of an upsurge among investors. However, this bull momentum was short-lived, as the price fell back below $2,000 just a few days later. The inability to maintain its position above $2,000 reinforces the psychological impact this level has on the mindset of the buyers and sellers, influencing their buying and selling habits. Despite the struggle with the $2,000 round number, there are still positive indicators suggesting that Ethereum could be on the verge of a bullish trend. Price is currently trading above both the weekly and daily 200 simple moving averages (SMA), which is a strong sign that the overall momentum favors the bulls. Additionally, the daily 50 SMA is a crucial support level for Ethereum, preventing price from falling too far and potentially aiding its ascent. This moving average has proven to be a reliable lifeline for the digital currency in its ongoing battle with the $2,000 mark. On Wednesday, Ethereum experienced a 5.4% surge, instilling hope among investors that the $2,000 barrier could finally be conquered. However, sellers quickly entered the market and forcefully pulled price back down to near the opening level for the day. This volatile period serves as a reminder of the importance of making decisions based on end-of-day data rather than intraday fluctuations, as it provides a clearer picture of price action. For Ethereum to successfully break through the $2,000 level, it must rely on the daily 50 SMA as a critical support. If this support fails, price could plummet to the next major support level, the daily 200 SMA, which is more than $300 below the current price. The ongoing struggle between Ethereum and the $2,000 price level demonstrates the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While there are bullish trend indicators in place, it is crucial for investors to closely monitor the daily 50 SMA as a lifeline for Ethereum's ascent. As the battle with the $2,000 round number continues, only time will tell if Ethereum can overcome this significant hurdle and embark on a new phase of growth.", "Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is set to unveil guidelines about the city's dynamic cryptocurrency framework in May, according to Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung. The consultation process for the regulatory framework received an overwhelming response, with over 150 participants sharing their views on the matter, Leung said. The upcoming licensing regime for crypto platforms is expected to allow retail investors to trade major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), which will take effect on June 1. See Also: John Oliver Joins Inverse Jim Cramer Craze, Says You'd Live '50 Years' If Cramer Predicted You'd Die 'Tomorrow' Hong Kong's vision is to establish a digital-asset center to enhance its reputation as a financial hub and \"encourage the development of virtual asset trading platforms,\" Leung said, according to Bloomberg News. TheSFC recently proposed a new policy that would allow retail investors to trade large-cap cryptocurrency tokens through licensed virtual-asset platforms. This move aims to regulate and protect investors in cryptocurrency investment activities that have been unregulated in the past. The new cryptocurrency regulatory regime will only allow \"eligible large-cap virtual assets\" to be offered to retail investors by licensed virtual-asset platforms. These virtual assets should be included in at least two acceptable indices issued by independent index providers. The new regime is essential to ensure effective regulation and protect investors from losses due to the \"increasing interconnectedness\" between the virtual-asset market and the traditional financial system, the SFC stated. Also Read:FTX Fallout - Bahamas Aims To Have Most Advanced Crypto Legislation Exchanges will decide which cryptocurrency tokens retail investors can trade, and how much they can invest, while platforms will need to assess investors' knowledge and set exposure limits for customers depending on their financial situations. Before offering cryptocurrency tokens to investors, platforms will need to consider various factors, including a virtual asset's management team, maturity, liquidity, and the security infrastructure of its blockchain protocol. The platforms will also set up token admission and review committees that follow through with the SFC's admission criteria and make final decisions on whether to admit, halt, suspend, or withdraw offerings. Hong Kong legalized retail access to cryptocurrency trading in 2022. In December, it passed the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill, introducing the new virtual-asset platform licensing regime. After June 1, unlicensed cryptocurrency trading activity will be a criminal offense.

Analyst Notes: Banking jitters have revitalized life back into cryptos.Bitcoin is surging and so are all the major cryptos as banking stress supports the use case for digital assets.Bitcoin is still facing a ton of resistance and this current rally will likely struggle until we get a clearer regulatory framework for cryptos, said Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA. Macroeconomist Henrik Zeberg predicts that Bitcoin is poised to skyrocket this summer as worries over an impending recession gradually fade away. Zeberg, who commands a following of over 109,000 on Twitter, asserts that with the king crypto leading the way, risk assets like cryptocurrencies are set to soar in the coming months. Based on Zebergs analysis, a blow-off top scenario is unfolding for both stocks and crypto, majorly spurred by a drop in fixed-income yields. Zeberg is of the view that the market rally will be driven by a significant decline in yields, while the economy will remain in the comfortable Goldilocks zone. Overall, the projection is that risk assets like Bitcoin will surge into the summer season.

Similarly, Dogecoin rejected the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), as did Shiba Inu. The rejection of that level indicates consolidation is likely needed before the cryptos gather the strength to make a possible break up into a bull cycle.

The Bitcoin Chart: Technical traders may have seen a reversal to the upside on the horizon for Bitcoin becausebetween April 21 and Tuesday, the crypto formed a rounded-bottom pattern on the 24-hour chart, which often signals bullish momentum is about to return. On Wednesday, Bitcoin was breaking higher on higher-than-average volume, which confirmed a high level of interest from the bulls. Between Monday and Tuesday, Bitcoin also back-tested the 50-day SMA, which was likely after the bears grabbed control between April 16 and April 21. The retracement to that level is healthy and the indicator is curling upwards, suggesting the 50-day may continue to guide Bitcoin higher. If Bitcoin closes the trading day near its high-of-day price, the crypto will print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Thursday. The next most likely scenario is that the crypto prints an inside bar pattern to consolidate. When Bitcoin retraces to the downside, bullish traders will want to see the stock print a reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, above $26,965. If that happens, a new uptrend will confirm, which will give bullish traders more confidence going forward.

The Sewer Passes received scores from the game and were turned into HV-MTL NFTs. Yuga Labs has remained one of the most trusted and valuable names in the NFT space, valued at $4 billion in 2022. The company also acquired Meebits and CrytpoPunks from Larva Labs, two of the earliest and most valuable Ethereum-based NFT collections.

While the $1,000 investment would be worth over $300,000 today from the four Bored Apes alone, theres actually more to the story. Every holder of Bored Apes gotthe equivalent of one Bored Ape Kennel Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT as well. With a floor price of 4.97 ETH ($9,101.89) for Bored Ape Kennel Club, the four NFTs would be worth $36,407.56 today based on the current ETH price.

Moya added, There are some clear signs of exhaustion with the growth of the global crypto market cap and if we are looking at a consolidation period, this seemed like a good time to get out. Bitcoin is holding onto the $29,000 level, but if downward pressure continues support does not emerge until the $28,550 region. Benjamin Cowen, a prominent cryptocurrency expert, in a YouTube video, asserted that Bitcoinreigns supreme over most altcoins as an investment asset. He said, Altcoins generally perform worse than Bitcoin in both bear and recovery markets. Cowen notes that altcoins seem to be in a perpetual macro downtrend when compared to Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Michal van de Poppe has pinpointed two critical levels that Bitcoin needs to break in the coming days. Firstly, breaking above $29,300 will trigger shorts to get liquidated. And secondly, the price needs to go up to $29,700 to get back in the range. Two crucial levels for #Bitcoin to break in the coming days.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -17.96%. Data provided by Glassnode", "Global Cannabis Holdings (GCH) is set to launch the GCH Token, a novel investment solution for the cannabis market. GCH holds equity stakes in 38 industry companies and projects, and aims to provide investors an easy and affordable entry into the global cannabis market through this tokenized investment instrument. The company told Benzinga that the GCH Token will utilize blockchain technology to showcase a diversified array of cannabis businesses worldwide. This will allow investors to profit from the industry's growth while minimizing exposure to individual companies or country-specific risks. The Compliance Aspect GCH Tokens will be issued on STOKR, a leading primary issuance platform for digital securities. STOKR, established in 2018 and supervised by Luxembourg's CSSF (financial services regulator), serves as a Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP). Its core offering includes providing end-to-end tokenization support for financial instruments from institutional-grade investment vehicles in Luxembourg. STOKR's advanced infrastructure and expertise have enabled GCH to issue tokenized securities on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to the main Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) network or Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). It is important to note that only verified investors can hold and trade GCH tokens. STOKR, as a VASP, offers the necessary verification support to GCH, ensuring that GCH knows the token holders at any given time for added security and compliance. GCH Tokens are not accessible to U.S. persons due to capital market regulations, and the entire process adheres strictly to European Union Capital Market Laws. Legal constraints dictate that GCH Tokens can only be issued during a new capital raise. The GCH Token's primary advantage, according to the team, is its diversified set of companies covering every main vertical in the cannabis sector. Companies and projects are selected early on based on their potential. The Investment Criteria GCH prioritizes projects with scientific and transformative impact beyond solely productive aspects. A committee of experts, including start-up world actors specializing in medical and scientific cannabis, selects these projects. Management highlights the cannabis market's diversity, with applications ranging from medical and recreational uses to industrial purposes such as hempcrete and plastics production. By investing in various industry verticals, GCH can capitalize on opportunities throughout the market. GCH has steadily expanded its portfolio of companies and projects from diverse countries and industry verticals. After thorough review by GCH's investment committee, this approach aims to boost GCH's valuation and, subsequently, the token's value. All companies in GCH's holdings possess the necessary licenses to operate in the industry, and a significant number have already reached post-revenue stages. GCH emphasizes the importance of focusing on research and development projects that advance medicinal cannabis use, as they have the potential to greatly enhance the quality of life for individuals with treatable illnesses and disorders. Andres Israel Naor, CEO and co-founder of CGH, stressed the importance of sustainable projects, stating that prioritizing sustainability ensures efficient initiatives with minimal environmental impact, while promoting corporate social responsibility. Naor added that prioritizing sustainable research and development projects is crucial for the cannabis industry to ensure a promising future for medicinal cannabis use, as well as social and environmental responsibility in the business sector. This collaborative approach can work towards a more just, prosperous, and sustainable future. More information about companies and projects is anticipated to be released soon. By leveraging blockchain technology to tokenize its holding company's equity, GCH aims to offer enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and transparency for investors.

BTC) dropped about 3.5%, ETH)lost 5%, DOGE) plunged 8.3% and Shiba Inu followed suit, declining about 5%. The U.K., like the U.S., has been battling stubborn inflation but while there are signs the Federal Reserves hawkish policy is starting to work to hamper inflation at home, data from the U.K. showed inflation rose 10.1% for the 12-month period. From a technical standpoint, Shiba Inus pullback appears healthy and when the crypto retraced lower, it held support at an ascending trendline and printed a possible higher low. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Shiba Inu Chart: When Shiba Inu dropped during Wednesdays 24-hour trading session, the crypto tested an ascending trendline as support and bounced up from the level. Shiba Inu has been trading above the ascending trendline since March 10 and has bounced up from the area five times. The rebound from the trendline had Shiba Inu looking to print a hammer candlestick on the 24-hour chart, which indicates a bounce could come on Thursday. If that happens, the crypto will have printed its next higher low within its uptrend, with the most recent higher high formed at the $0.00001188 mark on Sunday. Bullish traders want to see Shiba Inu climb above that area, which will confirm the uptrend is intact. If that takes place, the crypto will break up from a descending trendline, which could indicate a larger reversal to the upside is on the horizon. Bearish traders want to see sustained selling pressure drop Shiba Inu under the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. If that happens, the crypto will also break down under the ascending trendline, which will negate the uptrend and indicate a longer-term slide is in the cards. Shiba Inu has resistance above at $0.00001178 and $0.00001259 and support below at $0.00001081 and $0.00000975.

A letter signed by Republicans on the committee stated that national securities exchange standards are unsuitable for digital assets. The letter saidthat Gensler's frequent calls for businesses to \"come in and register\" are a \"willful misrepresentation\" of his agency's policies. When the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, U.S. Rep.Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican,asked if Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, is a security or a commodity, the SEC chair declined to comment, highlighting the persistent lack of legal clarity around the classification of crypto assets.

U.S. Rep.James French Hill, an Arkansas Republican,wanted to know if the head of the SEC is on board with congressional attempts to establish regulations for stablecoins, but Gensler dodged the question rather than answering it directly. U.S. Rep.Pete Sessions,a Texas Republican, criticized Gensler, saying it's contradictory for him to state that his personal beliefs aren't representative of the SEC's.

The crypto has been consolidating mostly sideways near the $30,000 mark since Tuesday, trying to make a run above the level but lacking volume. Benzinga called for Bitcoin tobreakfrom its triangle patternon April 6and for Ethereum to break from the same pattern on April 12.

The crypto market was still stronger than the general market, which saw the S&P 500 down about 0.6%. Spot gold was also retracing low, declining about 1.7% on the day. If Bitcoin can make a big break above the psychologically important $30,000 level over the weekend, traders and investors can watch for Ethereum and Dogecoin to follow. All three cryptos are trading in uptrends, which makes an eventual break up the most likely scenario. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: On Monday, Bitcoin broke up from a triangle pattern, which caused the crypto to run toward the $30,000 mark. The bullish break also caused Bitcoin to print a higher high, which settled it into an uptrend. Bitcoins most recent higher low within the trend was printed at the $27,814 mark on April 9 and the most recent confirmed higher high was formed at the $30,584 mark on Tuesday. On Friday, Bitcoin was looking to print a shooting star candlestick, which could indicate the next higher high has occurred and the crypto will retrace on Saturday. If that happens, bullish traders can watch for Bitcoin to print a possible doji or hammer candlestick above $28,000, which could indicate the next higher low has occurred and a rebound is on the horizon. Bitcoin has resistance above at $31.418 and $35,593 and support below at $28.690 and $25,772. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum has been trading in an uptrend since March 27, with the most recent higher low formed on Wednesday at $1,855 and the most recent confirmed higher high printed at the $1,943 mark on April 5. On Friday, Ethereum looked to be creating a long upper wick on its candlestick, which, like Bitcoin, could indicate a retracement is in the cards. The second most likely scenario is that Ethereum prints an inside bar pattern over the weekend, which would lean bullish for a continuation higher. Bears want to see the crypto fall back under the eight-day exponential moving average, which has been guiding the crypto higher since March 29. Ethereum has resistance above at $2,150 and $2,317 and support below at $1,957 and $1,846. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin confirmed a new uptrend on Thursday by printing a higher high. The cryptos most recent higher low, which negated its downtrend, was formed on Wednesday at 8 cents. On Friday, Dogecoin looked to be printing a doji candlestick, which could indicate the next higher high has occurred and the crypto will trade lower on Saturday. If that happens, bullish traders want to see Dogecoin print a bullish reversal candlestick above the 200-day simple moving average. If Dogecoin falls under the 200-day SMA, the uptrend will be negated, and a longer-term downtrend could be on the horizon. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.091 and $0.099 and support below at $0.083 and $0.075.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.

Parsec Finance revealed that the number of validators in the exit queue has exceeded 15,000 at the time of writing. Kraken's dominance in the unstaking queue is not surprising, given the legal issues it has faced with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In February, the SEC deemed Kraken's staking offerings to be unregistered securities, while other staking programs were unaffected. The SEC stated in a February release, \"The complaint alleges that Kraken touts that its staking investment program offers an easy-to-use platform and benefits that derive from Kraken's efforts on behalf of investors, including Kraken's strategies to obtain regular investment returns and payouts.\" Kraken eventually settled with the SEC for $30 million.

Heres a look at the history of Ethereum and what a return to all-time highs could mean for investors. What Happened: Ethereum was proposed via a white paper from co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2014. The goal of Ethereum laid out by Buterin was for Ethereum to add scriptingto make it easier for application development and to set up binding contracts. Ethereum was officially launched on July 30, 2015. During its first calendar year, Ethereum traded between $0.42 and $1.39 with a starting price of around $0.74. Over the years, Ethereum saw increased inclusion on cryptocurrency trading platforms like Coinbase. Major events and updates to Ethereum, including the fork of Ethereum 2.0 and Ethereum Classic and the Ethereum Merge, have increased interest in the cryptocurrency and acted as catalysts for the valuation of ETH. The boom of non-fungible tokens in 2021 helped increase interest in Ethereum, making the crypto a major player in the sector. Ethereum hit an all-time high in November 2021 at the height of the recent crypto boom. The cryptocurrency market was hurt by the bankruptcies of several crypto-related companies in 2022 and increased calls for regulation. A new update performed on April 12, 2023, is seeing Ethereum gain in value. The Shanghai update was deployed as part of Ethereums push to proof-of-stake, with the ability for validators to withdraw staked Ether. On Thursday, April 13, Ethereum crossed the $2,000 level for the first time in eight months, showing signs of optimism for the cryptocurrency.

In this article, we provide you with all the essential information about the Shanghai upgrade and its implications. Understanding The Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade The Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella, represents the largest network upgrade since the Ethereum Merge in 2022. It allows validators to withdraw staked Ether (CRYPTO: SETH) and rewards that have been locked up in the Ethereum network. This marks the completion of Ethereum's transition from a PoW to a PoS network, opening up new possibilities for scalability, sustainability, and mainstream adoption. Ethereum's Journey From PoW To PoS Ethereum started its transition from a PoW to a PoS blockchain in September 2022 with the Ethereum Merge. This upgrade replaced the energy-intensive PoW consensus mechanism with the more energy-efficient PoS, where users stake cryptocurrency to validate transactions and receive rewards for their participation. However, the merge didn't enable individual stakers to withdraw their deposited ETH or the generated rewards. The Shanghai-Capella upgrade addresses this limitation, allowing the withdrawal of staked ETH. Also Read:Regulation Rumble: Binance's CZ Drops Mic On Crypto's Future Shanghai Vs. Capella: What's The Difference? Though closely related, Shanghai and Capella are distinct upgrades. Shanghai focuses on the execution side of Ethereum, while Capella targets the consensus side. The two upgrades occur sequentially, with Capella taking place immediately after Shanghai. Implications For Ethereum Users If you haven't staked Ethereum but trade it, the Shanghai-Capella upgrade will not affect your interactions with the network. However, for those who have staked ETH, the upgrade has a significant impact on your staking account. You can continue to add to your staking accountand, for the first time, withdraw assets. Withdrawals are expected to be available a few weeks after the Ethereum upgrades are complete, as the processing time is set by the Ethereum protocol. Keep in mind that you remain liable for any taxes related to your staking or other crypto products. In Summary The Ethereum Shanghai-Capella upgrade is a monumental step forward for the Ethereum network and its stakers. It completes the transition from a PoW to a PoS consensus mechanism and enables the withdrawal of staked ETH and rewards. While the upgrade significantly benefits those involved in staking, it will have minimal impact on everyday users' interactions with Ethereum and the network's economics.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -7.88%.

The move came in tandem with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which was consolidating a three-day upswing with an inside bar pattern. Ethereum has been trading in a fairly tight trading range between $1,823 and $1,943 since April 5, when the crypto topped out at the upper area of that range. The sideways pattern has formed Ethereum into a rising wedge pattern. The pattern is considered to be bearish, although its possible Ethereum will break up from the upper ascending trendline of the pattern or negate the wedge by continuing to trade sideways. Bearish traders can watch for Ethereum to break down from the wedge on higher-than-average volume to indicate the rising wedge was recognized. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Ethereum Chart: Within the wedge, Ethereum negated its uptrend on Tuesday by printing a lower high. Ethereum continues to print higher lows, however, with the most recent higher low formed on Wednesday at $1,855. The eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) has been guiding Ethereum higher since March 13, which is bullish. If Ethereum closes below the eight-day EMA, it could be a good place for traders in bullish positions to lighten or close their position. Ethereum is set to meet the apex of the wedge on April 18. If the crypto continues to trade sideways after that date, the pattern will be negated and traders can watch for an alternative pattern to form. If Ethereum breaks up or down from the wedge on higher-than-average volume, both bullish and bearish traders will be able to gauge the future direction. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,957 and $2,150 and support below at $1,846 and $1,717.

What Happened: The report State of Crypto' cited a steady stream of enforcement actions and court cases that have been linked to this decline. Several metrics measuring crypto-related activity in the U.S. have declined in recent years, including the number of crypto developers in the country, which fell below 30% last year from nearly 40% in 2018. Furthermore, the report said there has been a continuous decline in the portion of traffic to crypto-related websites from U.S. users, dropping from around 23% in 2019 to just over 15% last year. See More: Top Indian Apps That Give Bitcoin, NFT Rewards Why It Matters: While the report noted that these declines could be influenced by other factors such as a decline in digital asset prices, it also highlighted the role of regulatory pressures, with several enforcement actions and legal cases filed by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in recent months. The report called for new rules and guidance from government agencies to dispel regulatory uncertainty and promote innovation in the U.S. crypto industry. Legislation such as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act and the Digital Commodities Exchange Act were also noted as providing much-needed clarity for the industry.

What Happened: While some traders and analysts have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the phased release of staked Ethereum, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode said only a tiny fraction of staked Ethereum will be sold following the upgrade. According to Glassnode, over 100,000 ETH of the total accumulated rewards is expected to be withdrawn and sold. Furthermore, the firm predicts that only 70,000 ETH will actually become liquid, representing less than 1% of the entire staked amount of 18 million ETH. See More: Top Indian Apps That Give Bitcoin, NFT Rewards Even in the most extreme case, the impact on Ethereum prices will be acceptable, the analytics firm said in its report. Glassnode revealed that staking providers such as centralized exchanges or liquid staking platforms represent over two-thirds of all staked ETH, with Lido currently leading the way with 5.9 million ETH staked and a share of around a third. While few staking providers will withdraw their validators, Glassnodes data also shows that around half of all Ethereum staked is currently in profit. Furthermore, the realized price of all deposits is currently $2,136, while the Ethereum realized price stands at $1,403. The Ethereum Shapella upgrade will offer two types of withdrawals for profit accumulation; a partial withdrawal that removes the validators staking rewards, reducing the balance to 32 ETH, or a full withdrawal which shuts down the validator, thus removing the entire staked balance.

According to crypto analyst Michal Van de Poppe, Bitcoin still holds a strong upward momentum, making it a force to be reckoned with, particularly through Q2. As Powells hikes come to an end, we can expect a boost in the Bitcoin market, just as we witnessed a significant rally in Q2 of 2019. However, Van de Poppe predicts a slight correction to $25,000 in the latter half of the year, attributing it to the potential slump in the economy. Roughly speaking my thesis for #Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has gained over 45% in the last month while Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has risen over 29% in the period. As the asset gains more traction, stocks linked to the sector are also recording significant gains. Here's a look at two of the trending stocks and some crucial trading levels factored in by the options market for the week: 1. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT): Shares of the Bitcoin-mining company have risen over 69% in the last month while its year-to-date returns stand at over 213%. The stock closed at $10.58 on Monday. Options expiring on Friday indicate relatively higher open interest build-up at the $12 level amongst out-of-the-money Call options. What is noteworthy is the fact that a significant open interest build-up can be seen at the $9.5 and $10 Call strikes, which are in the money at the time of writing. Since Riot shares closed over 15% on Monday and gained another 4% in extended trading, the possibility of a correction does exist  a notion supported by the options data. On the downside, an absence of a significant build-up on any particular out-of-the-money Put strike could be reflecting a lack of conviction about potential support. Also Read: Best Penny Stocks 2. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA): Shares of Marathon closed over 14% higher on Monday at $9.10 and gained another 4% in extended trading. Options data shows significant open interest build-up between the $8.5 and $10 Call strikes, indicating the levels could provide some resistance if the trend continues. On the downside, the $7 to $8 zone is expected to provide some support.

It is somewhat impressive that Bitcoin is slightly higher on a day that has stocks, oil, gold, and high-beta currencies all down around a half a percentage point.

The price of Bitcoin on Monday broke above $29,000, trading at levels not seen sinceJune 2022, while Ethereum is trading above $1,890, its highest range since mid-August of last year. Cryptocurrency analysts see rising opportunities for growth and usage, particularly overseas. However, the cryptocurrency outlook is nuanced. In the U.S., meaningful regulations and oversight are still a bumpy work in progress. The recent bank crisis and regulatory actions have highlighted the importance of stablecoins and their use as an on-ramp to crypto from fiat. Overall, 2023 is seen as a transition year for cryptocurrencies, with the hope that the crypto market will turn bullish in 2024. Interview with Brock Pierce, Co-Founder of Tether Billionaire investor, futurist, philanthropist, economist, and creator Brock Pierce told Benzinga in an exclusive interview that he believes that traditional finance firms are already beginning to invest in Web3 projects. This trend will only accelerate if the banking crisis continues. Normally, traditional financial markets plummeting has resulted in crypto plummeting, but this could be the beginning of a trend in which traditional finance and crypto markets take a distinct path that shows the unique strengths of decentralized finance. Also Read:Here's How Much A $1,000 Investment In Shiba Inu Now Could Be Worth If The Meme Coin Returns To Record Highs BZ: How should the average crypto investor view the bank failures of March 2023? Pierce:Is it officially time to start panicking? Abandon crypto and everybody start putting money under mattresses? I'm not sure what the right answer is, but I'm sure abandoning crypto is not the answer. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are responding positively to the banking crisis, as is gold. I think it's too early to know for sure what will happen. BZ: Were the banking failures a \"crypto event\" or an example of traditional finance's shortcomings? Pierce: I don't think that crypto really had anything to do with this. This was more of a social media and fear-based panic, combined with how the Fed has increased interest rates so many times over the last year, and Silicon Valley Bank had five-year treasuries. They shouldn't have been holding such a long-term paper. As a result, their bond portfolio is upside down, like the short squeeze on GameStop. They weren't marking to market the losses that they've effectively incurred, then combined with panic in the market in a short squeeze sort of event, similar to what we saw with GameStop. I don't associate this as a crypto-related event, though it has affected some crypto companies. They're not getting bailed out with taxpayer money. They have assets. They just didn't have liquidity. So the government is coming in to assist with short-term liquidity, to avoid greater panic. Still, it's not ultimately going to be paid for by taxpayers. BZ: As one of the founders of Tether, how do you think this will impact stablecoins  or at least USD-backed stablecoins  in 2023? Pierce: I don't think that this is going to impact the need and popularity of stablecoins. I think stablecoins are going to continue to have greater interest. I guess the question here is, does this have an impact on Circle (CRYPTO: USDC)? In the long term, it clearly had an impact in the very short term, when people heard funds were frozen, which caused the peg to break. But that's recovered. It may not have any long-term impact. We're dealing with so many existential threats right now. I mean, I'm in Poland right next to Ukraine, and the confidence in the financial system and banking are being impacted in meaningful ways. BZ: If traditional finance shows this kind of instability, do we have an opportunity for crypto to shine as a globally distributed solution? Pierce: The big cryptos are performing very well as is gold, in light of everything going on with the banking sector right now. It is one of the few times we've seen this correlation. Normally, the traditional financial markets dropping has caused crypto to drop. This is one of the first examples we've seen of one market crashing and crypto performing, which people would have always thought would be that the outcome of turbulence in the financial markets. It's taken turbulence in the banking sector for it to finally become uncorrelated or breakout, which is not what we've seen historically. Normally, traditional markets plummeting has resulted in crypto plummeting. So this is perhaps the beginning of a trend.

Analyst Notes: \"Bitcoin was mostly unfazed with nonfarm payroll report. It looks like crypto traders are headed for a long weekend as the consolidation phase remains intact as Bitcoin remains trapped in its range. Bitcoin needed a soft jobs number to trigger a market reaction and that is not what happened today. Regardless, Bitcoin still has the potential for a big move in the next couple of weeks.

As the popularity of digital currencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) hasskyrocketed, some experts are questioning their long-term impact on the global economy. CitingCharles Kindleberger's \"Manias, Panics, and Crashes(which, in-part, examines the cryptocurrency market as a mania) and author Robert McCauley's take that cryptocurrency is \"the most speculative asset ever invented by the human mind,\"Dieter Wermuth, economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management, said in a Wednesday note to investors that several economists of the European Central Bank have raised concerns about the long-term consequences of cryptocurrencies. Read Also:Bitcoin Will Go To Zero, But The Ride 'Is Not Going To Be A Straight Line,' Peter Schiff Says Economists have argued that cryptos are not a viable alternative to regular money, but rather an asset without substance, a system for insiders to get rich quick, and a haven for money launderers, tax evadersand other dubious characters. Additionally, economists have pointed out the massive energy consumption ofdata centers that power the crypto ecosystem, which, in turn, has contributedto climate change. Despite the initial narrative that Bitcoin would be a better, more stable currency than traditional money, Wermuth said the cryptocurrency has proven to be inadequate in fulfilling the three essential functions of money: as a means of payment, a unit of accountand store of value. Bitcoin's volatility, slow and expensive transaction processes,and limited acceptance as a form of payment inherently makes it a poor substitute for traditional fiat currencies, he added. As a store of value, Bitcoin is particularly deficient, Wermuth explained. It has no inherent value, no interest paymentsand no promise to redeem the purchase price or nominal value. This makes it impossible to calculate a \"fair\" price, rendering Bitcoin a purely speculative asset, he said. If market participants lose faith in its potential for price appreciation, Bitcoin could simply vanish, he warned. From a macroeconomic perspective, Wermuthsaid Bitcoin and other cryptos are \"a negative-sum game,\" causing a significant waste of resources. The socially undesirable redistribution of wealth, the high income earned by those dealing in a fundamentally useless asset, the facilitation of money laundering and tax evasionand the environmental costs associated with running the IT systems all contribute to a net loss for the economy, he explained. Ultimately, Wermuth said the global economy might be better off without cryptos, allowing for more funds to be directed towards consumption and investment.

Data provided by Glassnode", "The ambitious plan by the BRICS nations Brazil, Russia, India, Chinaand South Africa to create a new global currency is not only an economic endeavor but also a technological one. As these countries work together to establish a currency that could potentially reshape the global financial landscape, the technological aspects of this project are crucial to its success. Blockchain And Digital Currencies: The Foundation Of The BRICS Currency Blockchain technology, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies such asBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH), could play a pivotal role in the development and implementation of BRICS' new global currency. This decentralized, secureand transparent technology offers a more efficient and cost-effective way to process transactions, manage currency supplyand ensure the integrity of the financial system. By utilizing blockchain technology, the BRICS nations can create a digital currency that is not only more accessible but also less prone to manipulation and fraud. This new currency could benefit from the advantages of decentralization, such as reduced transaction costs, increased securityand enhanced transparency. Cross-border Payments And Financial Inclusion One of the significant challenges in the current global financial system is the inefficiency of cross-border payments. Traditional money transfer methods between countries are often slow, expensiveand complex. The BRICS-led global currencypowered by blockchain technologycould offer a faster, cheaperand more straightforward solution for cross-border transactions. The new currency could boost trade and economic integration among the BRICS nations and beyond by facilitating seamless cross-border payments. Furthermore, the digital nature of the currency could promote financial inclusion by providing individuals and businesses with limited access to traditional banking services an opportunity to participate in the global economy. Smart Contracts And Programmable Money Another technological innovation that could be instrumental in the development of the BRICS new global currency is the use of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code can automate various aspects of financial transactions, such as payments, settlements, and asset transfers. Also Read:On-Chain Data Reveals Crypto Profit-Taking Underway: Will Bitcoin, Ethereum And XRP Hold Up? Integrating smart contracts into the BRICS currency system could enable programmable money, where specific conditions must be met before a transaction is executed. This feature could lead to more efficient financial operations and reduced risks associated with fraud and default. Challenges And Considerations While the potential benefits of leveraging cutting-edge technology for the BRICS new global currency are significant, challenges and concerns must be addressed. Ensuring the security and stability of digital currency is paramount, as cyberattacks and technical glitches could undermine its credibility and value. Moreover, the BRICS nations must navigate the complex regulatory landscape associated with digital currencies and blockchain technology. They must develop a cohesive regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. The technological aspect of the BRICS new global currency is central to its success, as it could revolutionize the global financial system by harnessing the power of blockchain technology, digital currenciesand smart contracts. The potential benefits are immense, from more efficient cross-border transactions to increased financial inclusion. Addressing the challenges and concerns surrounding security, stabilityand regulation will be crucial to ensure the new currency's lasting impact on the global stage.

The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been trading under a key resistance level near the $28,700 mark since March 19. The sideways pattern has been formed on decreasing volume, which indicates the crypto is running out of both sellers and buyers. The pattern leans bullish but traders and investors can watch for big bullish volume to come in and break Bitcoin up from that level, which could signal a larger move to the upside is on the horizon. Alternatively, bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drive Bitcoin down under the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could signal a downtrend is in the cards. Bitcoin has resistance above at $28,690 and $31,418 and support below at $25,772 and $25,228. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum started trading in an uptrend on March 27 and has made a consistent series of higher highs and higher lows. Ethereums most recent higher low was formed on Monday at $1,763 and the most recent higher high was printed at the $1,943 mark on Wednesday. On Thursday, Ethereum was trading slightly lower, looking to print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate the next higher low has occurred and the crypto will resume its uptrend and bounce on Friday. Bearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under Mondays low-of-day, which will negate the uptrend. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,957 and the psychologically important $2,000 level and support below at $1,846 and $1,717. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin was trading over 3% lower during Thursdays trading session but on lower-than-average volume, which indicates consolidation. The crypto may be forming a bull flag pattern, with the 38% surge on Monday making up the pole of the formation and the three-day decline making up the flag. If the pattern is recognized, Dogecoin could be headed for the 12-cent mark. If Dogecoin closes under the eight-day EMA, the bull flag will be negated.

Arbitrum addresses governance issues by backtracking on the contentious Arbitrum Improvement Proposal 1 (AIP-1) that planned to allocate 750 million governance tokens, worth around $1 billion at the time, to the Arbitrum Foundation. The proposal appeared to be moving forward without token holder approval.Members of the project's decentralized autonomous organization voted overwhelmingly against it. Arbitrum now seeks to include community input and implement new AIPs, such as AIP-1.1 and AIP-1.2. The Arbitrum Foundation has committed not to move any of the remaining 700 million tokens in the Administrative Budget Wallet until the DAO approves an acceptable budget and smart contract lockup schedule. The foundation also released a transparency report regarding its initial formation, alongside the revised proposals.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The future of Bitcoin remains uncertain as it faces a psychological barrier at $30,000, leaving investors and traders navigating an unpredictable market. Could Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) be gearing up for a race to the top to catch up with Ethereum's(CRYPTO: ETH) recent surge? On Tuesday, the ETH coin skyrocketed by 3.2%, breaking through its previous high from March 23rd at $1858. The digital currency world is in for an exciting ride as the competition heats up. Will Bitcoin be able to keep up with Ethereum's momentum, or will we see a new leader emerge in the race to the top? Bitcoin investors may be feeling somewhat unfulfilled after a lackluster second half of 2022. Despite some brief moments of excitement, the price fluctuations remained locked in a frustrating range, with the floor at $15,473 and a ceiling at $25,207. Unfortunately, the new year hasn't brought any significant improvements in profitability for those holding out hope for a significant breakthrough. The first six months of 2022 brought a gloomier outlook for market investors as the sharp plummet from the all-time high of 2021 showed no signs of slowing down. In fact, the decline took a staggering nosedive of 67% during this period, which left many investors reeling from the significant losses. This was a tough pill to swallow for those hoping to see some recovery and stability in the market. After taking a plunge below the weekly 200 simple moving average support level, the downward trend hit a slow patch, leaving price stuck in a bit of limbo for a while. This uneventful period of sideways movement continued into the start of 2023. The markets were feeling bullish vibes at the beginning of the new year, with a noteworthy push upwards in January accounting for a 21% spike in price. March brought in another surge, propelling prices up by 18%. This epic push propelled price once again above the weekly simple moving average. Despite its promising start, the recent upward trend in price has hit a significant roadblock. After consistently hovering around $28,000, the market seems unable to push past this price. Even after making contact in March, price has struggled to break through this ceiling, leaving investors wondering when and if it will ever happen. The future of Bitcoin is shrouded in mystery as it approaches a potential turning point.

The Dangers Of Meme Coins Like all cryptocurrencies, investing in meme coins comes with high risk. Meme coins are associated with high volatility and scams like the \"rug pull.\" The rug pull is a fraudulent scheme in which developers create a token paired with standard cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) or Tether (CRYPTO:USDT), place the token on a decentralized exchange, and withdraw all funds after purchasing by investors. This scam has affected several meme coins, and investors have lost millions of dollars. The lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market makes it challenging to identify and prosecute scammers. Is It Worth Investing In Meme Coins? The lack of fundamental value makes it difficult to predict the long-term growth potential of meme coins. However, some investors have made a fortune by investing in meme coins like Dogecoin. In May 2021, Dogecoin reached an all-time high of $0.74, making it more valuable than some established companies like Dropbox. Investing in meme coins requires careful research and analysis of market trends. It is also essential to be aware of the risks associated with meme coins, such as high volatility and scams like the \"rug pull.\" Danny Talwar, Global Head of Tax at Koinly told Benzinga that while investing in these coins can be tempting due to their meteoric rise in value, it's essential to understand that they're highly speculative assets. Consider the potential tax implications when trading to avoid any unexpected tax bills that could potentially reduce overall returns, especially as we near the end of the U.K. and U.S. tax seasons, Talwar said. According to Gasper Stih, Marketing Director at Zonda Global, the vast majority of meme coins lack the fundamentals typically found in investment assets, such as a business plan, solid tokenomics, a professional team, or a roadmap with growth potential. Many of them were created as jokes or \"memes\" (hence the name) and are not intended as long-term investments. Most are not eligible for listings on regulated exchanges like Zonda, Bitstamp, and others. Therefore, it is essential to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before to making any investment decisions, Stih said.

With BTC trading at around $28,452 at the start of the quarter, this price level has acted as a critical resistance point over the past few weeks. If Bitcoin is unable to break above $28,452 in the short-term, a bearish deviation (fakeout) could be on the horizon and drag the price lower. On the other hand, should the 4-hour triangle breakout to the upside, this would likely propel Bitcoin prices higher. Pseudonymous analyst Kaleo believes that ETH has had a solid bounce relative to BTC in the past several days.

An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend. Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.

This suggests that Bitcoin is preparing for a period of price rises. Pizzino notes that confirmation of this phase may take one or two more weeks on the chart, and it will most likely happen if Bitcoin breaks above the 50% level, which is around $42,000. However, Pizzino also cautions that Bitcoin still needs to test the low to mid-$30,000 range before moving higher.

The number came in at 4.6%, slightly under the 4.7% rise analysts expected, which indicatedthe Feds hawkish policy is starting to lower stubborn inflation. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were also rebounding on Friday after sinking lower during Thursdays session. All three cryptos have been consolidating mostly sideways for a long period of time under strong resistance levels. Traders and investors will be watching the crypto sector over the weekend for clues as to how the stock market may behave next week. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating under a resistance level at $28,700 since March 19, unable to close a 24-hour trading session above the area. On Friday, Bitcoin attempted to bust up through the resistance but ran into a group of sellers who dropped the crypto down from the area. Bitcoin has been holding support above the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) since March 13 and on Friday tested the area as support before bouncing higher. The eight-day EMA is curling upwards and may continue to guide the crypto higher, through the $28,700 mark over the weekend. The crypto negated its downtrend on Thursday by printing a higher high of $29,190. If Bitcoin is able to break up through that area over the weekend, Fridays low-of-day will serve as the higher low to confirm a new uptrend. If Bitcoin falls under the eight-day EMA, it may find support at the 21-day EMA. Bitcoin has resistance above at $28,690 and $31,418 and support below at $25,772 and $25,288. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum confirmed a new uptrend during Fridays 24-hour trading session by printing a higher high, which was above the most recent high of $1,827, printed on Wednesday. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum was unable to break above a strong resistance level at $1,846. Bullish traders want to see the crypto break up through that level over the weekend, which would confirm Thursdays low-of-day is a higher low within Ethereums uptrend. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and knock Ethereum down under the eight-day EMA, which will negate the current uptrend. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,846 and $1,947 and support below at $1,717 and $1,546. The Dogecoin Chart: Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is also trading in a mostly sideways trading pattern but recently Dogecoin has also settled into a triangle pattern on the daily chart. Within the pattern, Dogecoin has been making a series of lower highs and higher lows, indicating consolidation. Dogecoin is set to meet the apex of the triangle on April 4 and traders and investors can watch for the crypto to break up or down from the pattern on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and $0.091 and support below at $0.075 and at the 7-cent mark.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Digital public goods (DPGs) consist of open-source software, models, and standards that countries can utilize to develop digital infrastructure as an alternative to private, proprietary solutions. Built on the Layer 2 solution Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC), thepilot project aims to facilitate communication between DPG stakeholders when deliberating potential new features. Maharajan explained, In essence, we are creating a specialized DAO for each DPG to bring all stakeholders together. He added the community surrounding a DPG could collectively decide its future direction. UNICEF has also experimented with the open-source voting tool Snapshot for potential governance proposals, a method similar to that used by conventional decentralized organizations. Also Read:Shiba Inu, Ether And VGX Tokens: What's Happening With Voyager's Crypto Assets? The ultimate objective is for these projects to utilize the DAO to finance new features approved by the community. The DAO concept is part of UNICEF's broader initiative in the cryptocurrency space, which established the UNICEF CryptoFund for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) donations in October 2019. The CryptoFund supports startups that offer innovative technologies for children as part of a larger venture program. It specifically aims to help these startups become DPG-certified through the Digital Public Goods Alliance. Four donors have contributed thus far, including ETC Labs,Animoca Brandsand Huobi Charity. Sanna Bedi, who manages the UNICEF CryptoFund, noted that itfollows the same due diligence process for cryptocurrency donations as for private donors, meaning anonymous donations are not permitted. The organization has invested in 41 cryptocurrency startups in registered UNICEF program countries. One such startup is Rumsan, a Nepalese blockchain-based cash and voucher assistance platform. Rumsan connects aid organizations with distribution entities, allowing for easy tracing of aid via blockchain technology, Maharajan explained. Despite the challenges of managing a cryptocurrency fund, Bedi characterized UNICEF as \"flexible\" and \"willing to learn\" about blockchain technologies. Bediemphasized the importance of sharing the organization'sexperiences and maintaining transparency, acknowledging it has encountered obstacles along the way. Bedi revealed the organizationiscautious when it comes to embracing new technology andUNICEF's custody arrangement was not affected by recent crypto banking crises. While Bediexpressed interest in potentially accepting USDC donations, she noted such a decision would depend on market considerations.

Citi analysts suggest that the next wave of crypto adoption will be primarily driven by the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the tokenization of real-world assets. @Citi 10th Annual Digital Money Symposium in London today. Looking forward to meeting everyone and representing @swiftcommunity in the panel discussion on 'The Regulated Internet of Value' #CitiDigiMoney #swift #innovation #cbdc #citi #digital #money pic.twitter.com/1jSR4xpgte March 30, 2023 CBDCs are a digital alternative to cryptocurrencies such asBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC)orEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and they are expected to be pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar or British pound. The central bank of the issuing currency will control these digital currencies, with current trials indicating that most of them will not be blockchain-based. However, some of these digital currencies will have blockchain interoperability or be DLT-specific. Ronit Ghose, CitisFuture of Financelead, projected that $5 trillion will be circulating in the economy in CBDCs by the end of the decade. To put this in context, that is roughly the nomimal annual gross domestic product of Japan, the worlds third largest economy. The report cites many advantages for this swift adoption, including an interoperable payment instrument and enthusiasm from developing economieswhile also acknowledging the risks involved in adoption, including privacy concerns and the potential for users to withdraw their deposits from smaller commercial banks to move over to CBDCs. In its macro blockchain outlook, Citi estimates that blockchain tokenization in general could grow by a factor of 80x in private markets by 2030. The report cites disintermediation within financial markets, composability with cryptocurrencies, and a shared golden-source infrastructure as the key efficiencies associated with tokenization. Blockchain tokenization refers to the process of converting real-world assets or rights into digital tokens on a blockchain network. These tokens are essentially digital representations of the underlying assets, which can include anything from financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and commodities to physical assets like real estate or art. One of the major roadblocks in achieving this golden standard in that to date, very few jurisdictions have offered a clear framework for adopting traditional assets on-chain. Thus, the disintermediation offered by these technologies could render some jobs in the financial industry obsolete. Overall, Citi believes the potential for blockchain technology to deliver value is not just limited to finance. The authors believe that blockchain could revolutionize other sectors such as gaming, with the potential for tokenized assets and smart contracts to provide new experiences and revenue streams. Furthermore, the report suggests that blockchain technology is no longer a niche concept but is set to become a mainstream technology with significant implications for various industries. As the technology advances, businesses and governments will need to embrace blockchain to remain competitive in the rapidly changing landscape. Citi Joins Bank Of America View The CBDCs Will Gain Increasing Prominence Citi becomes the latest major bank project CBDCs will gain prominence over the coming years. In January,Bank of Americathe second largest bank in the U.S.issued a research reportdescribing CBDCsandstablecoinsas the natural evolution of money and payments. https://t.co/K3OWRMdNcR ... #CBDC #USA #Dollar #USD #BoA pic.twitter.com/1ICxDEMX9Q January 17, 2023 The banks analysts went on to add that central bank digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize global financial systems andmay be the most significant technological breakthrough in the history of money,extolling many of the same virtues of CBDCs since this new idea of money first picked up real support a half decade ago. Meanwhile, theU.S. Federal Reservehas already announcedthat itsFedNowservicewill begin operating in July. and its implementation will have several phasesof preparation.The Fed will begin the formal certification of participants in the first week of April for the launch. As some believe, this could segue into the use of CBDC as a digital alternative to the fiat dollar.

A solution could now be available, and it involves non-fungible tokens. What Happened: Ticketmaster made headlines for its site crashing due to demand from Taylor Swift tickets and tickets being sold for huge amounts on the resale market. The Ticketmaster issues around Taylor Swift have prompted lawsuits and callouts by members of Congress. Anew ticketing system recently testedwith a rock band could be a way for the company to solve demand issues and make sure that true fans get the best chances of buying tickets. Ticketmaster, a unit of Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), recently partnered with hard rock and metal band Avenged Sevenfold for its upcoming 2023 summer tour. The band and ticket company partnered on a NFT-token gated feature using the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain and an existing collection of NFTs, as reported by Decrypt. Avenged Sevenfold previously launched Deathbats Club, a collection of 10,000 Ethereum NFTs. The NFTs are available on the Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) NFT marketplace and have a floor price of 0.1469 ETH, or around $264 at the time of writing. Owners of Deathbats Club NFTs got first access to several Avenged Sevenfold concerts in popular cities New York City and Los Angeles. Avenged Sevenfold frontman Matt Sanders, known as M Shadows, told Decrypt the token gated ticket launch went incredible. Shadows said around 1,000 tickets were bought for the New York and Los Angeles shows using the NFT token gated feature. Shadows said the purchasing process using the NFTs could lower the competition for tickets and use of bots in the initial process. Certain sections of upcoming concert dates will be reserved for NFT holders. Avenged Sevenfold will also launch an NFT-based loyalty program in the future that includes benefits and additional NFTs. The band will utilize NFTs as ways to unlock merchandise, music release and will give out POAPs (proof of attendance protocol) at concerts. The band is also considering airdropping passes to its top listeners and fans on music streaming platforms like Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). Related Link: Ticketmaster Diving Deeper Into NFTs, Will Blockhcain Ticketing Catch On? Why Its Important: NFTs have served as access passes for numerous items like live events, sporting events and more. Tickets have long been seen as a benefactor of the technology and a way for fans to show loyalty and get rewarded for loyalty. Linking to live shows created a unique value, and we developed our token-gating capabilities based on how artists want to connect their community to their concerts, Ticketmasters EVP of Global Music David Marcus told Decrypt. Ticketmaster now allows any music artist who has their own NFT collection or partners with an NFT community to use the token gated feature for ticket sales or other fan features. Avenged Sevenfold used the capability to offer first access to tickets, but there are a variety of ways it can be used by artists in the future from unlocking premier seats to special experiences like sitting in on soundcheck. Marcus said that Ticketmaster has minted around 15 million NFTs or digital collectibles using the Flow blockchain (CRYPTO: FLOW) and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC). This includes past partnerships with the National Football League and the recent launch of NFT capabilities for artists. Ticketmaster processes 500 million tickets per year and may be one of the biggest names to integrate Web3 technology into its existing platforms. Artists like Taylor Swift looking for a way to reward loyal fans and keep bots from getting the first access to tickets may need to look no further than NFTs and Web3.

The rebound has been fueled by speculation that central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, will abandon their aggressive rate increases in response to recession signals. This speculation gained momentum after three U.S. banks collapsed and the central bank launched emergency funding programs to arrest panic in the banking sector.

They benefit from liquidity injections. \"With the Fed suddenly turning on a dime, having to throw some QE back into the system to protect the banking system, money flows into sound money assets: gold, silver.

A daily close below this level could potentially expose Bitcoin to the range highs of between $25,200 and $26,860 between August 2021 and February 2023. However, the more significant test for bulls is $27,700 resistance to open up $28,900. Im still leaning cautiously bearish while Bitcoin is below $28,900 on the higher time frames. As mentioned in Discord last week, I still have my BTC short at a $28,133 average.

Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that Binance, under the guidance of Zhao, instructed its employees to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to disguise their locations. Following the lawsuit's filing, the price of Bitcoin dropped by around $1,000, and Binance's exchange token,Binance Coin (CRYPTO: BNB), fell by roughly 3%. The CFTC asserted that Binance purposefully established a complex system of corporate entities to obscure its actual operations and reach, including its U.S. affiliate,Binance.US. The filing states that Binance's intricate structure is intended to \"obscure the ownership, control, and location of the Binance platform,\" adding that \"Zhao answers to no one but himself.\" A Binance spokesperson told Benzinga the lawsuit is \"unexpected and disappointing,\" adding that Binance has been working collaboratively with the regulatory agency for more than two years. The exchange has invested in its compliance efforts in the last two years to ensure that U.S. users are not active on the platform, the spokesperson said. Binance's compliance process includes the following, according to the company: mandatory KYC for all users worldwide, country blocks for U.S. residents, blocks of U.S. citizens regardless of where they live, blocking devices using a U.S. cellular provider, blocking logins from U.S. IP addresses and preventing deposits and withdrawals from U.S. banks for credit cards.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space.

The announcement came Wednesday after the market close, which sent the stock down. Heres what analysts are saying about the potential regulatory hurdles ahead for Coinbase. The Coinbase Analysts: KeyBanc analyst Alex Markgraff has a Sector Weight rating on Coinbase and no price target. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau downgradedshares from Outperform to Perform and removedan $84price target. Needham analyst John Todaro has a Buy rating and $73price target. Related Link: Coinbase Q4 Results And Guidance 'Encouraging' But Regulatory Risks Remain: Why Analysts Are Mixed On Ratings, Price Targets The Coinbase Takeaways: Markgraff said the Wells notice indicates the SEC could file enforcement action against Coinbase, but the action is somewhat vague at this time. No charges/enforcement action were presented against Coinbase connected to the Wells Notice as of March 22, 2023, though such notices generally precede future charges/enforcement action per our understanding, the KeyBanc analyst said. Coinbase indicated the regulatory action could impact its spot market, staking service and several other product offerings, he said. We cant assess the model impact with high confidence at this juncture given the apparent lack of detail from the SEC and obvious lack of explicit charges/enforcement action though do recognize the materiality of certain products/services mentioned in the Companys announcement as it relates to revenue/adjusted EBITDA contribution. The analyst said this will not be a non-event for Coinbase and could see Coinbase receive charges, enforcement action and monetary penalties. Lau said he is supportive of blockchain and digital asset development in the U.S., but sees regulatory efforts increasing and potentially hurting Coinbase and others. Following the Wells Notice from the SEC and the recent Economic Report of the President criticizing the digital asset industry, we are downgrading COIN from Outperform to Perform, the analyst said. We raised concerns about the blockchain development in the U.S. after the demise of three banks. Lau said Coinbases stock is up over 100% year-to-date versus a 3% gain for the S&P 500, which could be reason to move to the sidelines. Under this unhealthy regulatory climate, we are increasingly worried about the fairness of the enforcement actions, and the ability for the ecosystem to grow with seemingly limited and shrinking support from the banking system in the U.S. The analyst said the cryptocurrency sector could be scapegoated for recent failures of specialized banks. Recent strength in Bitcoin indicates that people have called for alternative financial systems, but it could also become the victim of its success. While we downgrade Coinbase shares, we believe both upside opportunities and downside risk have increased substantially, and we may find an attractive risk/reward entry point in the future. Todaro said that cryptocurrency peer Kraken settled with the SEC last month on a staking product, which could be similar to what will occur with Coinbase in the future. While we think at least part of the notice was anticipated, we believe the concerns over asset listings were not, Todaro said. Todaro said the majority of Coinbases trading volume comes from Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) at 40% and 15%, respectively. The notice is likely targeting alt-coins, which could have a lower impact, he said. COIN Price Action: Coinbase shares are down 9.88% to $69.52 late Thursday morning.

Aavegotchi has been a bright project in this dreary market  appearing on lists from AltCoinBuzz for top Polygon Ecosystem tokens and top Polygon NFT collections. The newly formed AavegotchiDAO showed foresight in its recent decision-making  such as decoupling its GHST utility token from DAI tokens on March 11, just before DAI lost its USD-peg. Aavegotchi head developer and CEO of Pixelcraft Studios, Coder Dan, noted the fortuitous timing on Twitter. when this shitstorm is over i fully expect all of the mainstream crypto news to writes articles on how @aavegotchi somehow picked the EXACT DAY OF DAI'S DEPEG to close the $GHST bonding curve\r\n\r\nholy shit what a story\r\n coderdan.eth | aavegotchi (@coderdannn) March 11, 2023 We spoke with Coder Dan to understand their work in mutable NFTs with flexible rarity and DeFi sensibilities for incentivizing users. BZ: How did Aavegotchi begin? What was the intention behind it? Coder Dan: Aavegotchi came from the idea of value into NFTs. We asked, 'what if we took a DeFi token, this Ave token that actually generates interest, and put it inside an NFT? What would that look like?' From that brainstorm came Aavegotchi, which is part DeFi and part NFT. It's like a crypto pet that doubles as a piggy bank and generates interest for its owner. So, the crypto pet side is the Gotchi part, and the DeFi part is the Aave. Together, they form Aavegotchi. BZ: How have you incorporated the ability to build the value of the NFTs on-chain? Coder Dan: Aavegotchii uses what we call the Spirit Force. That's the token collateral that you have the NFT linked to. And it's the interest-bearing version of that token provided by Aave. It is like the soul of the Aavegotchi. Also Read:Sony PlayStation NFTs Could Be Here Soon And Users Might Get To Use Them On Xbox, Switch Consoles BZ: How can you enhance your NFT rarity in-game? Coder Dan: We said, if it's a pet, we should be able to interact with it on chain. So we created a system called Kinship, where every day you have to pet your Aavegotchi, which means you have to do an on-chain transaction. But simulating the old Tamagotchi vibes, if you ignore it the kinship value does go down by one point every day and the NFT loses value. We call it Proof of Attention (POA). You pay attention to it, and you devote some of your time and energy to doing these on chain transactions, and it actually loves you more and becomes more valuable. Your avatar can also level up on-chain. We have XP events where community members will come to, like, a discord call or Twitter spaces. Or they will also when they vote in our DAO. We have one of the most active DAOs in the world because their Aavegotchi actually improves when they vote in our DAO. BZ: Are you using wearables to enhance the value of characters NFTs? Coder Dan: There are six traits that are randomly generated. Energy, aggression, spookiness, and brain size are the four numeric traits that are randomly generated when you make your Aavegotchi. And then there are two others - eye shape and eye color. Of these six traits, four of them are mutable. We also have wearables, which are other NFTs that can be equipped onto your Aavegotchi, it not only looks cooler, because it has some gear to show off, but it actually makes it more rare because you're equipping these child NFTs which also have different rarity tiers. We're definitely one of the first NFTs to experiment with on-chain wearables that are equipped on your Aavegotchi. BZ: How does keeping so many of the mechanics on-chain serve the players better? Coder Dan: Were on-chain maximalists. We love everything to be on chain. If you buy most NFTs, and the server that hosts that picture goes down, suddenly, your NFT picture is gone. We thought that was ridiculous. So we put all of the Aavegotchi data  the image and character data  on-chain. You can actually go on to the smart contract and there's a call function that shows you the latest state of your Aavegotchi with all of its wearables. We even have views of all four sides, with wearables equipped, and you can call that, and you can get your Aavegotchi. And then you can put it into a world like the Gotchiverse, and you can use it as your avatar in an actual game. It can raise its hands, it has different emotions that it can show. So it's a fully equipped on-chain avatar that you can kind of plug and play into a game that you're creating. We're also going to put all the stats about the Aavegotchi on the chain. So at the XP level, that kinship, the different traits that it has are tracked and available if you want to recreate and play your character in another game. Summary\r\nAt the time of writing, Aavegotchi has about 2,000 daily players on average, though they said that they have peaks of 10,000 players. The game is still rolling out in phases, but according to their 2023 timeline, it seems to be on track with the recent launch of AavegotchiDAO. This year, Aavegotchi is partnering with Polygon to be one of the first projects to use its \"Supernet\"technology  a permissioned offshoot of the Polygon that will use the Aavegotchi GHST tokens as gas for transactions. Expectations need to be recalibrated around what P2E can bring to users. Users may not be able to make a living playing Web3 video games, but putting value into the development of your character seems like a reasonable incentive. It's just a little game with big ideas, and, like the Gotchis in the game, those ideas will grow and evolve.

What Happened: As the owner of the PlayStation video game consoles and several video game studios, Sony is one of the leading companies in the video game sector. While other video game companies are shying away, Sony appears to be getting deeper involved with non-fungible tokens. A new patent filing from Sony shows several ways the company could use NFTs in games. Systems and methods are disclosed for determining that a first-end user entity has performed a task within a computer simulation for which a non-fungible token is to be provided, where the NFT is associated with a digital asset, the patent says. One item that caught the attention of gamers on social media quickly was the mention of other consoles and platforms. Ownership of the NFT may also be subsequently transferred to other end-user entities for their own use across different simulations and/or platforms. The patent mentions cross-console capabilities, specifically naming the Xbox console from Microsoft Corp(NASDAQ:MSFT) and video game maker Nintendo(OTC:NTDOY). The patent also mentions that cross-platform capabilities could make the NFTs usable across different Sony-owned consoles like the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The present application related generally to NFT frameworks for transferring and using digital assets between game platforms. The patent refers to the NFTs often as digital assets and said that they could represent items like skins, video game artwork, an avatar, a video game weapon or a video game skill. NFTs could be earned through gameplay according to the patent and in some cases be offered as first-come, first-serve rewards. The patents also indicated that Sony wants the NFTs to work with virtual reality headsets, augmented reality headsets, smartphones, tablets, computers and televisions. Related Link: How To Buy NFTs Why Its Important: The latest patent filing by Sony follows up on a filing reported by Benzinga in November 2022. At the time, Sony filed for several patents involving the blockchain and digital assets. This included tracking digital assets in video games. In traditional video games, there is no way to differentiate a specific instance of an in-game item that a famous player of the video game used to win a famous tournament from any other instance of the in-game item, the patent said. The patent from Sony indicated the company could make digital assets tied to celebrities and esports winners. Sony could also create NFTs of video clips of gameplay. Sony is not the first company to explore use cases of NFTs in video games and likely wont be the last. Ubi Soft Entertainment(OTC:UBSFY) announced the launch of in-game NFTs in December 2021 and additionally in February 2022, utilizing its library of intellectual property to enter the growing Web3 gaming space. Square Enix (OTC:SQNNY) announced plans for a Web3 game called Symbiogenesis, which will use NFTs from the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain. Square Enixx has signaled support for blockchain in games for years. The wording of cross-play and cross-platform and the mention of the rival Xbox console could be interesting as Microsoft has remained quiet on NFT gaming plans. Microsoft owns Minecraft maker Mojang, which announced it would ban integrations of NFTs. Video game retailer GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) launched its own NFT marketplace to enter the growing space and has been looking for games to partner with. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which owns the Twitch video game streaming platform, is also rumored to be launching an NFT marketplace in April. The Pokemon Company, which is partially owned by Nintendo, is looking to hire someone with knowledge of NFTs, which could suggest the gaming and card company could be exploring the use cases of digital assets. Sonys patents dont guarantee that games will have NFTs anytime soon, but the multiple patent filings indicate the company has aspirations to connect in-game items like skins and avatars to the world of NFTs.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin is trading in a confirmed uptrend, with the most recent higher high formed on Tuesday at $26,553 and the most recent higher low printed at the $23,931 mark on Wednesday. On Friday, Bitcoin spiked up above Tuesdays high-of-day to confirm the uptrend is intact. If Bitcoin closes the trading day near its high-of-day price, the crypto will print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday. The next most likely scenario is that Bitcoin enters into a consolidation phase to print an inside bar pattern, which would be bullish for continuation. If Bitcoin ends the trading day with a significant upper wick, it could indicate lower prices are on the horizon. A retracement is likely to occur soon because the cryptos relative strength index (RSI) is nearing overbought territory. Bitcoin has resistance above at $28,690 and $31,418 and support below at $25,772 and $25,288.  The Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is also trading in an uptrend, with the most recent higher high formed on Tuesday at $1,787 and the most recent higher low created at the $1,613 mark on Wednesday. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum didnt print a higher high on Friday and if the crypto trades lower on Saturday, the current uptrend will be negated with the formation of a lower high. Also like Bitcoin, Ethereum may begin to consolidate over the weekend, which would lean bullish. Ethereums RSI has room to run before entering overbought territory. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,957 and $2,150 and support below at $1,717 and $1,564. The Dogecoin Chart: Like Ethereum, Dogecoin is trading in an uptrend but on Friday, could be forming a lower high to negate that trend. As it stands, Dogecoins most recent higher high was formed on Tuesday at $0.077 and the most recent higher low was printed at the $0.067 mark on Wednesday. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is trading under the 200-day SMA, which indicates the crypto is in a bear cycle. If the crypto is able to break up above Tuesdays high-of-day, however, Dogecoin could regain the 200-day, which would be bullish. In terms of Dogecoins RSI, the crypto has room to go in either direction because the indicator is measuring in at about 48% but the momentum leans bullish. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and $0.083 and support below at $0.07 and $0.065.

What Happened: Buterin, in a Reddit post, discussed the importance of multi-sig and social recovery wallets for securing cryptocurrency assets. He explained that these tools both use the concept of guardians or signatories for added security, but differ in implementation and use cases. Self-custody is important. And social recovery and multisig is a great way to do it.\r\n\r\nA quick reddit post on how I think about choosing guardians for social recovery and multisig wallets:https://t.co/FY1iyJ6BFC\r\n vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 17, 2023 See More: Top Indian Apps That Give Bitcoin, NFT Rewards With multi-sig wallets, funds are securely held with multiple signatories, reducing the risk of loss due to a centralized entity. He said using a multi-sig wallet offers the holder the assurance and peace of mind that funds are safe and secure without solely relying on the user to take all the necessary security measures. Social recovery wallets offer an extra layer of security  in addition to the protection that comes with a single key to sign transactions  without sacrificing user-friendliness. Buterin notes that with emerging technologies like ERC-4337 account abstraction and advanced wallet services like Soul Wallet, social recovery wallets make it easier for users to sign transactions, even if their key is lost. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations' savings, he added.

He has gone on record multiple times in the past to urge investors to sell their Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) holdings. Last week, Cramer urged investors to exercise caution while dealing with Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is still subject to manipulation. On Mad Money, Cramer warned that \"Bitcoin is a strange animal,\" and investors should sell their holdings amid the rally. Cramer in Decembersaid that he sold all of his Bitcoin and bought Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) instead, noting that people actually use the latter to transact. However, he sold his Ethereum position after he found out his bank was unwilling to accept it.

Lubin praisedGensler, who formerly headed the CFTC, sayinghe believes that the latter and the SEC are leading the charge in decentralizing \"our vast ecosystem.\" He even went asfar as to say that Gensler is a shining knight of decentralization.\" See More: Top Indian Apps That Give Bitcoin, NFT Rewards In a video posted on Tuesday by Digital Asset Investors YouTube channel,Lubin backed Gensler for halting Kraken's staking product and calling them securities. Kraken settled with the SEC on Feb. 9, paying a $30 million penalty, in response to allegations that it had operated an unregistered security offering through its staking program. Lubin said the exchanges staking product was centralized, and therefore, a security offering. He added that despite claims of decentralization, the yield paid to stakers made it clear that Kraken was taking significant proactive steps, which suggests it isn't actually as decentralized as originally claimed. If you advertise that youre a very decentralized thing in such a way that it sounds like people are going to make money based on your effort, just that language can make it a security, Lubin added.

Only oneout of threeusers of Arbitrum, a second-layer blockchain running on Ethereum, have received 1,000 tokens or more in an airdrop designed and facilitated by Nansen, a blockchain analytics startup. Analyst Notes: Bitcoin is higher as Wall Street grows confident that efforts are being made to contain this banking turmoil and as central banks globally are continuing with their respective tightening cycles. The ECB went ahead with their half-point rate rise and expectations are improving for the Fed to deliver one more hike. If the Fed might is done tightening after the March 22nd meeting, that will keep the economy in slowdown mode and support expectations that we should start seeing labor market weakness in the Spring, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Moya added, Despite losing a couple [of] important crypto banks, the plunge in yields is welcome news for many crypto startups.As the economy heads towards a recession, the cryptoverse could look more attractive than equities. It appears the downside risks are greater for the S&P 500 than they are for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Justin Bennett in a blog post updated his Bitcoin outlook, predicting a potential 20% increase in value. In a new analysis, Bennett suggests that the historic 35% pump seen over the past five days is not the end  instead, he believes that Bitcoin may have further upside if the price can close above $25,000. If this happens, he predicts BTC could surge over $30,000. An aggressive bounce from the $23,000-$23,500 area could send BTC back to $25,200. And a daily close above $25,200 would signal the next leg up toward the $28,000-$30,000 region. But all of that is contingent on a solid bounce from the mid $23,000 area. Analyst Bob Loukas said BTC seems to be chipping away at overhead resistance at the $25,000 range in an early cycle move.

Billions of dollars are currently locked in DeFi lending protocols like Aave, MakerDAOand Compound. These applications are only useful for the richest 1% of crypto users, as large sums of capital are needed to take out loans. Enter Huma Finance, a startup that creates income-backed DeFi loans, using off-chain data on a person's income to qualify them for crypto loans. Huma Finance claims to make DeFi lending accessible to everyone  an idea that resonated with many developers who participated in a hackathon ahead of ETHDenver. Huma Finance co-founders Erbil Karaman and Richard Liu explained how the company can bring DeFi lending to the people that need it most: \"Huma is an income-backed DeFi protocol for the 99%. There's a huge global unmet capital need for small businesses and people; local institutions can't meet their needs, and they can't get loans in crypto because they're only built for whales that can stake their assets. We built a protocol where different lending businesses can be launched to serve this unmet need in emerging markets. Invoices they get off-chain can be put on-chain and be brought to life, being utilized through capital markets in DeFi.\" KryptoKredit, a startup building on top of Huma Finance, was a hackathon winner. The company allows users to earn an on-chain credit score for their cash transactions. During KryptoKredit's presentation, the team acknowledged the low accessibility to credit. Only 23% of people currently have access to credit, while many more deal in cash. By using Huma Finance, vendors and payers can be incentivized to bring cash transaction data on chain, allowing for anyone with access to the internet to build a credit score. There's clear interest from developers on Ethereum to make lending more accessible to those that need it most, which Karaman elaborated on during the interview: \"We just announced our $8.3 million seed round, and we have over 20 other builders already creating use cases on Huma Finance,\" Liu added, \"We launched last Thursday, and the message was well received; people felt it just makes sense. I didn't expect so many people to build with us. So many people came to our booth, I lost my voice.\" Why Web3? Karaman chose to build in web3 rather than a traditional fintech solution because came down to decentralization, infrastructure, and incentivization mechanisms: \"We feel there's a huge global need for these kinds of services. It's hard to serve these needs going through traditional institutions, and we saw there's a huge opportunity to build these technologies using web3. We came to ETHDenver last year and won the DeFi track Hackathon, and since we got so much support from the community, we kept building,\" Karaman told Benzinga. \"Compound and Aave are asset-backed protocols. But in real life, everything uses future income to qualify for loans. That primitive income is missing from web3. We built the stack from the ground up to understand different income sources, figure out the mechanisms to tokenize them, then enable the pools for people to build for different use cases,\" Liu says. From a high level, Liu explains how income can be tokenized via NFTs, allowing for use cases throughout Ethereum's ecosystem: \"We've launched with on-chain partners SuperFluid, Circle, and Request Network, and they mint the payment stream as an NFT,\" Liu says. \"Whoever owns the NFT will own the income stream. Say you have an invoice for $5,000, it can be tokenized as an NFT and the owner of the NFT has rights to the payments from that invoice.\" Ethereum's foundation is built on permissionless, trustless, and immutable concepts that may be most impactful for the unbanked and underprivileged demographics. Today, the industry is stereotyped by the concentration of wealth the technology has created, yet builders are most excited about the innovation helping the 99%, leveling the playing field by creating a more accessible ecosystem. Without these builders, crypto stands a slim chance of becoming a ubiquitous financial technology.", "CryptoPunks are a generative art collection, and one of the first ever applications of NFTs for digital art.

This token will be distributed to community members via an airdrop on March23, marking the official transition of Arbitrum into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). ARB holders will be given the power to vote on important decisions governing Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova networks, which enable users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain with greater speeds and lower fees, Coindesk reported. The Arbitrum DAO will be responsible for core protocol-level decisions, such as technology upgrades and how revenue from the chain can be used to support the ecosystem. Although a large portion of tokens (44%) will be granted to investors and core contributors, Offchain Labs, the creator of Arbitrum, believes the ARB token will make the ecosystem more decentralized than other scaling chains.

To determine eligibility for the ARB token airdrop, Arbitrum worked with Nansen, a crypto analytics firm, to \"snapshot\" user activity in February. The eligibility criteria included factors such as the number of transactions, the number of different applications used, and the duration of usage for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nitro. Users can check their eligibility for the airdrop and claim tokens by visiting gov.arbitrum.foundation, but they are advised to be cautious as scammers may use this occasion to trick people via spoof websites and other scams.

Before diving into some of the leading projects building ZK infrastructure, its important to understand what ZK Proofs are. Zero Knowledge Proofs ZK Proofs allow verifiers to prove that a party meets a certain set of criteria without revealing the specific information that qualifies the party to meet those criteria. In the case of transactions, ZK networks can verify transactions while sending the minimum possible data to Ethereums mainnet, allowing for maximum scalability. Regarding ZKs in DeFi, the technology can be used to preserve the privacy of users while enabling these users to leverage their data for financial functions. Benzinga discussed use cases for ZKs and income-backed DeFi loans with Huma Finance co-founder Richard Liu. Here's what he said: In our case, we want to look into off-chain income in order to borrow against it. Working in fintech, theres a lot of user information associated with income. In crypto, privacy-preserving technology is so important; I only need to know you have that capacity, I dont need to know the details that prove it,\" he says. \"Were looking into ZKs to receive the essential information we need without extracting any additional information from users. Builders have already begun to build on top of Huma Finance using Zero-Knowledge proofs. Building a credit-enabled ZK wallet, the hackathon group Joey Finance deployed Huma onto ZKsync in order to reap the benefits of Zero-Knowledge proofs for credit building. Technical Differences Between ZK Networks Benzinga then talked with Scroll, a leading ZK EVM. There are currently three approaches to zero knowledge networks, as Pseudo, the teams researcher, distinguishes below: There are three categories of ZK EVMs: Byte-code compatible, language compatible, and ZK VM. Byte-code compatible would be Scroll and Polygon Hermez, which means at the lowest level of compilation for solidity contracts, all the opcodes are mapped to circuits, allowing for all the ZK stuff to be abstracted away under the hood. With language-compatible ZKs, theres an intermediary virtual machine; in ZKSyncs case its the LLVM. Its kind of like an emulator. With ZK VMs, you need to use different languages, but its more circuit-friendly, which makes things easier; this is the case for Starkware. At Scroll, applications on Ethereum can port over to our network with no changes in their code. Multiple ZKEVMs Existing In Tandem ConsenSys has an umbrella of influential products with millions of users, including Metamask and Infura. Consensys head of research Nicolas Liochon explained that its useful to have multiple ZK EVMs exist in tandem. \"We see the future of ZKs similar to where layer 1 is now. On layer 1, there are multiple clients, so no one client has too much power. We think the long-term positioning of ZK EVMs will be the same, while not being that different from one another. At the end of the day, its not about having different capabilities of ZK EVMs, its about having a choice between them, thats key. Liochon advocates for multiple ZK EVMs for decentralization. Also, as a part of security, ZK EVMs are using complicated cryptography, he says. Because of the complexity, there is the risk of bugs that will persist. \"By having multiple provers, just like on layer 1, if theres a bug on one of the provers, there wont be the same bug on all of the provers,\" Liochon adds. \"Because of this, bugs cant be used to take my money and so on. ZKs could also be integrated into Ethereums layer 1. However, his optimistic outlook predicts zero knowledge on layer 1 is still five to 10 years away from coming to fruition. He continues: The fact that people can trust the layer 2 means that there will be more users and applications. Once the technology is proven and trusted with time, it can move to the layer 1. Then, the layer 1 can use this logic; its a possible future but it may take 5 or 10 years. I think Im optimistic on the timeline unfortunately, but its a very valid vision. The Beginnings Of ZKEVM Technology Mint Ventures explained the earliest ZKEVM equivalent projects and their importance for scaling Ethereum. As a research-based venture firm for digital assets, Mint Ventures continuously releases reports on trends in the blockchain space. According to Mint Ventures researcher Snapp Ye: In July 2022, Polygon was the first to announce the implementation of ZKEVM equivalence. Within a month, the Polygon token price soared from $0.34 to $0.95. Polygons surge caused unprecedented Layer 2 fever... Layer 2s are very noteworthy for several reasons; the processing capacity of Ethereum is extremely limited, and a large number of Layer 2s are needed to achieve capacity expansion and thus land in the real world on a large scale. On the other hand, with the drastic increase of on-chain application scenarios, the demand of on-chain applications for execution layer is also more diversified, and massive Layer 2s with different features interacting through the main chain of Ethereum may be the trend of blockchain in the future. Many networks have yet to release their own tokens, and future airdrops on these networks are likely, Ye added. While there will be more airdrops coming from new scaling solutions, many networks informed Benzinga that they are not considering a native token for the network. The ConsenSys ZK has no current plans for a token, while the Scroll team uses Ether as the gas token on the network. Regardless, ZKs will continue to have a huge impact on blockchain scalability, and there will be investment opportunities spurring alongside the technologies development. Even if networks opt to forgo a native-token, applications will arise that take advantage of the innovation in various ways.", "Reuters Fed Mulling Tougher Rules For Midsize Banks After SVB Crash TheFederal Reserveis reportedly mulling stricter rules and oversight for midsize banks that are similar in size to the collapsedSilicon Valley Bank.

Glassnode data reveals the total number of Ethereum burned has recently reached a staggering 3 million.At the current price of $1,708 at the time of publication, this amount equates to slightly over $5 billion. What Are Ethereum's Burn Tokens? Ethereum's burn tokens refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulation. The process involves sending the tokens to an inaccessible address, rendering them unusable. This process aims to decrease the supply of tokens over time and increase their value. It is worth noting that these burned Ethereum units were previously intended to benefit miners who no longer exist due to Ethereum's transition to aproof-of-stake blockchain. London Fork And Burn Tokens The London fork, which was enactedin August 2021, introduced several major changes to the Ethereum network. One of the most critical changes was the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. This proposal introduced a fee-burning mechanism that aimed to reduce the volatility of Ethereum's transaction fees. The EIP 1559 proposal involves burning a small fraction of the transaction fee paid by users for each transaction. This process ensures the tokens are removed from circulation, thus decreasing the overall supply of Ethereum tokens. Since the implementation of the London fork, the number of Ethereum burned has steadily increased, reaching a total of 3 million in the first week of March 2023. Implications OfEthereum's Burn Tokens The burn tokens represent a significant milestone for the Ethereum network. Decreasing the supply of tokens is expected to increase Ethereum's value over time and lower the inflation rate. This increase in value is expected to attract more investors and users to the network, ultimately leading to greater adoption. Edited Image via pixabay and flickr.

The crypto-market has longed for more approval from mainstream investors, so current events will certainly become a boost for the crypto space, he added. Cuautemoc Weber, co-founder and CEO of Gateway.fm said due to the exotic nature of crypto, many hedge funds saw this asset as a good diversifier in normal market conditions, however, the situation is evolving as the cryptocurrency market becomes more integrated into traditional financial markets, leadingto increased correlation. In the long run, the crypto markets will become less volatile and risky in line with broader adoption and acceptance of blockchain technologies. It will likely open a door for risk-aware investors, and more capital will flow into the industry, he added.

NFT artist Dave Krugman also expressed disappointment and called it a short-sighted move,noting that it has the potential to help creators engage their audiences and push back against the damaging effects of attention-based advertising economies.

It's recommended to keep an eye on the price dominance of Bitcoin vs. other top cap altcoins. BTC had been giving up a lot of ground to alts to start the year, and this may be a nice signal of a trend change for the Bitcoin maxis, the data platform said in a blog post. According to Santiment, it's recommended to watch out for any significant spikes in FOMO and discussions about a potential $25,000 Bitcoin price. We did see a pretty huge spike when Bitcoin soared above $24,000 earlier today, which seemed to stop the price rally in its tracks. But if the euphoria tapers down a bit, it could be a good sign that we will indeed broach this level once again, the platform added.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Experts suggest that this correlation is expected, given the impact of hundreds of billions of dollars, where investors tend to rush towards safer havens, such as gold or cryptocurrencies, in such cases. However, this event cannot be seen as a singular factor to derive the correlation between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial market, according to them. Commenting on the correlation, Edul Patel, the co-founder, and CEO of Mudrex told Benzinga that investors tend to rush towards the safest haven in times of market troubles, such as gold. Read:CZ Speculates On Government Plot To Take Down Banks; Circle Responds To SVB Fall He further added that in the long run, reduced volatility can be expected as the asset class matures. Robert Quartly-Janeiro, the Chief Strategy Officer at Bitrue, commented on the bailout being a lifeline for the technology and VC space and how a capital and lending crisis has been averted, which would have affected new technologies with utility struggling after the SVB issues. He said that the global nature of cryptocurrency trading makes it both correlated and uncorrelated, depending on the level of investor reaction. Marius Grigoras, the CEO of Bhero, welcomed the surge in the cryptocurrency market and highlighted that it presents a significant opportunity to offer a more diversified investment portfolio for both cryptocurrency and traditional investors. He added that regulatory compliance will increase adoption and acceptance from traditional financial industries, leading to more liquidity, increased stability, and a broader range of investment opportunities for both retail and institutional investors. Alex Faliushin, CEO of CoinLoan said that the U.S. government technically gave a signal that if it is required to save the economy, they will print more money or save institutions, and their clients, respectively, from sinking due to poor risk management.\r\n\"What it says is that the crypto market is part of the global market and reacts to any kind of positive news just like other assets. More money andliquidity means the markets will go up naturally. Even a slight hint of potential QE and the money will immediately enter the market,\" he said. In the long run, the gap will likely narrow even more as many see Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and other decentralized assets as the opposite of fiat currencies that can be printed and distributed just like that, he further said. Next:JPMorgan Predicts Impending Disaster For Crypto Market Following Silvergate Shutdown", "Kicking off the 2nd day of ETHDenver, Uniswaps (CRYPTO: UNI) Design Lead Callil Capuozzo announced the leading decentralized exchanges latest product: Uniswap Wallet. QR codes were circulated around the venue to get early access to Uniswap Labs latest product, but nobody was sent to download the app from the app store. Instead, users had to download TestFlight, then download the Uniswap Wallet from the little-known platform. Uniswap addressed its problems with Apple on its Twitter account: So why a limited early release from a team committed to access for anyone? Simply put, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) wont green-light our launch, & we dont know why. We submitted our mobile app months ago  and even though we are 100% compliant with their specifications, were still stuck in limbo. The Uniswap Wallet is Uniswap Labs foray into the mobile wallet sector, a competitive industry where Coinbase, Robinhood, and Crypto.com have similarly branched into over the last few years. However, Uniswap Labs unique positioning as a trusted DeFi brand, paired with its knowledge of on-chain activity, may give it a unique advantage over these incumbents. Capuozzo acknowledgedUniswaps edge when asked why the team decided to launch a wallet. \"Weve had ambitions to do a wallet for years. Hayden, Uniswaps founder, and I have talked about this since the early days. Weve always known that people were struggling with the edges of the swapping experience,\" he said.\"Its a moment for our organization to gain more knowledge. Were experts at swap, and we are so good at making that the best user experience. Now we want to do the same thing for wallets.\" He continued, I think the whole thing about what Uniswap Labs is doing these days is taking our expertise and learnings to build the next Circle around these core experiences. We think were well positioned to do this; we have a great brand that people know and trust. Also Read:Shiba Inu's Much-Hyped Shibarium Officially Launches In Beta Form Circle is related to USD Coin (CRYPTO: USDC), similar to how Uniswap Labs is related to the Uniswap DEX, while also creating products in the NFT and wallet sphere. Through multiple product offerings, both companies are able to provide streamlined user experiences in an industry where exceptional user experience is still rare. Next, Benzinga asked about Uniswap governance. Uniswaps UNI token is the governance token of Uniswap, allowing holders to vote on proposals that determine the future of Uniswap. Cappouzzo distinguishes that UNI governance is for the Uniswap Protocol, which does not encompass other Uniswap Labs products, such as the Uniswap Wallet. Governance is all about the protocol. The protocol is successful and independent; its running on chain and governed by UNI token holders. Everything about the protocol is governed by Uniswap governance. Uniswap Labs, the company, builds stuff on top of the protocol and on top of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Stuff like experiences, interfaces, and pushing things forward. Benzinga asked Capuozzo what industry trends will continue to gain prevalence in 2023. He pointed to the recent Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-4337), Account Abstraction. He also mentioned that Account Abstraction will become even more important in light of Base, Optimism and other layer 2 chains, as these networks provide better accessibility to retail users. Account abstraction is a huge one. I think it will be transformative, but it may take a couple years to get to the place I expect it to. I think the evolution of L2s, especially on EVM networks like OP and Base, will go hand in hand with account abstraction to make gasless experiences possible. Users wont even have to know which chain theyre on.Capuozzo said. Lastly, he told Benzinga about its partnership with Moonpay, which hasnt been advertised by the team up to this point. Strategically, the Uniswap wallet has been able to secure a deal with Moonpay to offer the cheapest fiat-to-DeFi on ramp currently available. We have a partnership with Moonpay, and weve negotiated the cheapest way to onboard fiat to crypto out of any DeFi protocol. It used to take hours to get on chain, but today you can onboard with Moonpay and be ready to use Uniswap and Ethereum within minutes,Capuozzo noted. Certainly, Apple can impede the adoption of blockchain given its 1.5 billion-strong user base.

USDC's value has risen by 4.5% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.995, according to CoinGecko data. However, the coin's value dropped as low as $0.87 over the weekend amid concerns about $3.3 billion worth of USDC reserves held by Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB), which was shut down by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation on March 10.

Circle would soon have a new transaction banking partner with automated minting and redemption, potentially as soon as the following day. The announcement from Allaire and the Federal Reserve has resulted in a significant asset price surge across the market, with a surge in the values of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ether (CRYPTO: ETH) and the total crypto market cap rising above $1 trillion. This increase occurred despite the collapse of Signature Bank, which was considered the last crypto-friendly bank standing in the U.S. after the closure of Silvergate and SVB.

As the banking crisis continues, here's a look at crucial support and resistance zones factored in by the options market for the week: 1. Bitcoin: Options market data indicate the token is witnessing multiple levels of resistance with significant open interest build-up seen at these strikes. The $23,000 and $25,000-Call strikes on options expiring this Friday are witnessing a significant open interest build-up, indicating the levels could act as a stiff resistance. If Bitcoin manages to breach this level, the $26,500 level will prove a major hurdle to cross as maximum open interest build-up is seen at this level. On the downside, the $17,000-$18,000 zone is expected to act as a decent support for the week. 2. Ethereum: Options market data indicates the $1,700-$1,800 zone will be a crucial resistance area for the token this week as shown by open interest build-up in out-of-the-money Call strikes across two platforms. On the downside, the $1,400-$1,450 area provides decent support for the short term. It is worth noting that open interest data only provides a fair idea about support and resistance levels. Any major news or macro event could lead to a significant movement in the asset prices which in turn could shift the open interest, especially during times like these when crisis prevails.

The current president has outlined many priorities and signed many executive orders since taking office, including some that deal with cryptocurrency regulation. Heres a look at how some top cryptocurrencies have performed during Bidens time in office. What Happened: In 2022, Biden signed an executive order to establish the first-ever comprehensive federal digital assets strategy for the United States. The executive order was put in place to establish cryptocurrency regulation. An American approach to digital assets is one that encourages innovation but mitigates the risks to customers, investors, and businesses, broader financial stability, and the environment, the White House said after the orderwassigned. Items like the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and an invasion of Ukraine by Russia led to spikes in the price of several of the top cryptocurrencies in early 2022.

Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin started trading in a downtrend on Feb. 21 and has made a consistent series of lower highs and lower lows. The crypto's most recent lower high was formed on March 5 at $22,654 and the most recent confirmed lower low was printed at the $21.988 mark two days prior. During Thursdays 24-hour trading session, Bitcoin printed a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which indicated lower prices were likely in the cards for Friday. On Friday, lower prices came but the crypto was attempting to bounce up from its low-of-day. If Bitcoin closes Fridays session with a significantly lower wick, the crypto will print a bullish hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come on Saturday. A bounce is also likely because Bitcoins relative strength index (RSI) is measuring in at about 27%, which puts the crypto in oversold territory. Bullish traders want to see Bitcoin bounce because if the crypto continues lower, it will lose support at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which puts Bitcoin in bear territory. Bitcoin has resistance above at $20,545 and $21,313 and support below at $19,915 and $18,385. The Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum entered into a downtrend but on Feb. 16 and has been making a series of lower lows and lower highs. In Ethereums case, the most recent lower high was formed on March 5 at $1,588 and the most recent confirmed lower low was printed at the $1,547 mark on March 3. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum was working to print a hammer candlestick during Fridays session, with the bottom of the hammer just above the 200-day SMA, which indicates a bounce could be on the horizon. Ethereums RSI hasnt quite reached official oversold territory but is beginning to curl higher, which is bullish for the short-term. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,564 and $1,717 and support below at $1,308 and $1,231. The Dogecoin Chart: Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which entered into downtrends more recently, Dogecoin has been trading in that pattern since Feb. 4. Dogecoins most recent lower high was created on March 7 at $0.075 and the most recent confirmed lower low was formed at the $0.072 mark on March. 3. Dogecoin was also working to print a hammer candlestick during Fridays 24-hour trading session, which could indicate a bounce is on the horizon. Dogecoins RSI is measuring in at 23%, which indicates the bounce could be strong when it comes. Dogecoin has resistance above at 7 cents and $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and $0.057.

What Happened: Over the past two years, NFT collections have been launched by Web3 startups, existing brands, celebrities and athletes. A new NFT was launched this week that is connected to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) co-founder Buterin. Quadratic Funding Open Editionis the first from Metalabels Quality Drop series and celebrates onchain records of The Quadratic Funding Collection. The NFTs celebrate the work of Buterin, Zoe Hitzig and E. Glen Weyl with contributions from Scott Moore and Kevin Owocki. The NFTs were released as an open edition on March 1 but went relatively quiet until early Wednesday. The open edition allowed users to mint as many NFTs as they wanted before a 12 p.m. ET cutoff on March 8. The cost of the NFTs was 0.05 ETH, or around $77.53 on Wednesday. A limited edition of signature NFTs was also available via dutch auction with a starting price of 12 ETH. The limited-edition NFTs look different and also come with a physical signed copy of the whitepaper. The NFTs look similar to album covers and include a digital version of Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design for Philanthropic Matching Funds, a whitepaper from 2018 signed by Buterin, Weyl and Hitzig. A total of 9,209 NFTs were minted, a relatively low supply given the strong name recognition of Buterin. Over $780,000 was raised from the NFT mint. The proceeds will be split 70% to Gitcoin, 20% to Plurality Institute and 10% to Metalabel. Along with initial mint proceeds, the organizations will get royalties from secondary sales. Buterin agreed to reissue the whitepaper he co-authored for the NFT mint and sign the 12 physical copies for the NFT drop, a Metalabel representative told Decrypt. Related Link: How To Buy Ethereum Why Its Important: Since the whitepaper was released in 2018, over $70 million has been used for open-source projects using quadratic funding by Gitcoin and other organizations, according to the website. Buterin has 4.7 million followers on Twitter but has not posted about the NFT collection. Many were unaware of the collection until the mint had closed. Some NFT alpha groups, including MetaverseHQ were able to alert their Discord members of the open edition and 0.05 ETH mint price. In a TIME interview, Buterin highlighted the positives and negatives of cryptocurrency and took a potential shot at one of the most popular NFT collections of all time. The peril is you have these $3 million monkeys, and it becomes a different kind of gambling, Buterin said, potentially taking on Bored Ape Yacht Club. Buterin argued profits from crypto shouldnt be used to buy yachts and cars, but rather for public good. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the amount of crypto donations that had been made to support Ukraine in the war efforts as a positive at the time. The goal of crypto is not to play games with million-dollar pictures of monkeys, its to do things that accomplish meaningful effects in the world, Buterin added. Price Action: The Quadratic Funding Collection NFTs soared in value Wednesday hitting highs of more than 0.60 ETH. At the time of writing, the floor price is 0.463 ETH, or $717.90. The signature limited editions have a floor of 62.9 ETH, with one selling for 22.22 ETH on the secondary market.

The estate consists of 166,464 plots of land  each plot is 2,500 square feet in the metaverse. Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses. Smart contract blockchains can secure ownership of digital assets, so these networks play a crucial role in building out the metaverse.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.

Chen's long-term bias is that risk assets will continue to trend higher once there is areturn to a disinflation regime, although this may take a few months. Chen's comments highlight the changing market dynamics, where the deleveraging and derisking efforts have likely already occurred, thus reducing the vulnerability of equities and cryptocurrencies to a selloff.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Data provided by Glassnode", "Ethereum's mainnet experienceda major upgrade on March 1 with the deployment of EIP-4337, which brought with it a brand-new token standard known as ERC-4337. The idea for this token standard was first introduced back in September 2021, and now it's finally a reality. If you're an Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)enthusiast, you may have heard about the proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4337 and the buzz surrounding it. But what exactly is account abstraction, andwhat does it mean for the Ethereum ecosystem? Let's break it down. EIP-4337 is a proposal aimed at bolstering the security of the Ethereum blockchain by modifying the way in which certain smart contracts are processed. The suggested changes would make it tougher for cybercriminals to manipulate smart contracts and engage in nefarious activities, such as stealing funds. In a nutshell, account abstraction is a way for Ethereum users to interact with the network using a single type of account, making it more user-friendly. This proposal puts less emphasis on externally owned addresses and allows for a generalized approach to account types, which opens up new possibilities for use cases. Also Read:Meme Coin Named After Jim Cramer Rockets 182% In A Week, Leaving Dogecoin, Shiba Inu In The Dust One exciting aspect of account abstraction is delegation, which allows one address to make changes to the balances of another address without owning the assets within that address. This opens up possibilities for automation and custom logic within wallets, making it easier to carry out transactions based on certain rules. Some potential use cases include robo-advising, AI investing, and automating tasks like claiming rewards or adjusting yield farming positions. This has huge implications for the DeFi world and could pave the way for new and innovative applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. Overall, account abstraction is an exciting prospect for Ethereum and its development. Stay tuned for more updates on this proposed improvement and its potential impact on the crypto space.

He said on Monday that while the market is currently acting in support here, indices have already seen a bounce and look to be continuing to do so. Van de Poppe warns that if Bitcoin cannot hold above the $21,500 level, we could be in trouble. Boring price action on #Bitcoin since the correction, but still acting in support here.\r\n\r\nIndices bounced already and seem to continue to do so.\r\n\r\nMight have another sweep of the lows and then reverse up, losing $21.5K = trouble time. pic.twitter.com/6GyzaiqZ3U\r\n Michal van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 6, 2023 Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wav laid out a convincing case for Bitcoin pushing its all-time highs by the end of this year. The four reasons, according to him, are: A less steep rate of appreciation A duration of time that is equal to the length of the bear market allowing for natural appreciation That we are only at the midway point of the logarithmic growth curve channel and That BTC is already 25% of the way. Trader Tone Vays believes Bitcoin (BTC) might be headed for a huge rally into six-figure territory, as high as $300,000. Vays shared his forecast with his 123,000 YouTube followers: if the next Bitcoin bull run follows the same pattern as previous cycles, BTC could soar between 792% and 1,238% from its current levels. So this is my projection. Theres two paths. We can hit this line [diagonal resistance] twice like we did in the last cycle. We can hit this line once near the end like we did in the prior cycle [2017]. If we hit it near the end, were going to go higher $300,000. If we hit it twice, were going to go lower $200,000.

Shares of Silvergate Bank fell by a staggering 58% during trading in the U.S. on Thursday and continued their downward spiral on Friday. The bank allows cryptocurrency exchanges and other customers to exchange cryptocurrency for fiat money, and its fall has sparked concerns over the stability of the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase Dumps Silvergate: Another factor contributing to the market downturn was Coinbase's (NASDAQ:COIN) decision to suspend payments to Silvergate. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, cited \"technical issues\" as the reason behind the suspension.

A recent review of emails and documents revealed that the companies took the recourse ofshadowy intermediaries, fake documents, and shell companies to reinstate their access as reported by the Wall Street Journal. According to the report, one of Tether's intermediaries, a Chinese-based tether trader, attempted to bypass the banking system by providing counterfeit sales invoices and contracts to facilitate every deposit and withdrawal transaction. The owner of Tether Holdings Ltd., Stephen Moore, signed these fake invoices and contracts but later recommended abandoning the practice as too risky.\r\nSee Also:Tether Freezes $46M In USDT Owned By FTX In Response To Law Enforcement Request WSJ claims that the U.S. Justice Department has been investigating Tether. The inquiry, which the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office oversees, has caused concern for Tether's future. However, the company denies the Wall Street Journal's report, calling it wholly inaccurate and misleading. Tether has assured the public that it has a world-class compliance program and complies with legal requirements. Tether's significance lies in its unique role as a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a bridge linking crypto volatility and USD stability. Its value stability attracts investors who view it as a money-market account at a brokerage. USDT usually trades more volume than Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) combined, according to CoinMarketCap. Tether's efforts to maintain banking access became urgent when Wells Fargo & Co. stopped processing transactions from several Taiwanese accounts that Tether was using in March 2017. The companies quickly found solutions by opening new accounts using established business executives and tweaking company names. These tactics have since raised concerns about potential fraud and money laundering issues, leading to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities.\r\nSee Also:Crypto Should Get Back to Its Roots to Break Free from Traditional Finance.

Here is a look at how much Dogecoin has grown in value since Musk first mentioned the cryptocurrency. First Tweet: To get a starting value for Dogecoin, we will look at two price points. On April 2, 2019, Musk replied to a tweet saying \"Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency.\" Years later, Musk would acquire social media platform Twitter. \"Its pretty cool.\" The response came to a poll that voted Musk the winner of the fictional title of CEO of Dogecoin with 49% of the vote. @elonmusk You can't decline! pic.twitter.com/5F0RAncfBo\r\n I am Hodler  (@iamhodler) April 2, 2019 ETH)co-founder LTC) creator Its inevitable pic.twitter.com/eBKnQm6QyF\r\n Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 18, 2020 While Musk often tweets about Dogecoin, which can lead to spikes in the price of the meme coin, the Tesla CEO caught some followers on social media by surprise Friday. \"I used to be in crypto, but now I got interested in AI,\" Musk tweeted. The tweet from Musk, which may have been in reference to the growing number of companies and investors focused on artificial intelligence, sent the price of Dogecoin down shortly after.\r\nRelated Link: 'I'm Mainly Supporting Doge,' Elon Musk Likes That Dogecoin Has The Memes, Dogs And A Sense Of Humor Dogecoin Return: Dogecoin traded at $0.002552 on April 2, 2019, around the time of Musks first tweet mentioning Dogecoin. If you bought $100 in Dogecoin at that time, you would have 39,185 DOGE today. The value of the $100 investment would now be $2,999.61based on a current Dogecoin price of $0.07655 at the time of writing. Dogecoin traded at $0.003084 on July 17, 2020, at its highest price. A $100 investment on that day could have bought 32,425 DOGE. The value of the $100 investment would have grown to $2,482.13 today. Dogecoin hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021. At its peak, these $100 investments in Dogecoin based on Musks tweets would have been worth $28,902.86 and $23,916.68 respectively.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were following Bitcoin in the sector downturn, slipping more than5%. The drop in the three cryptos confirmed that Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin are still trading in downtrend patterns. A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart. The lower lows indicate the bears are in control while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify a downtrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend. Descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term downtrend. A stock often signals when the lower low is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bullish engulfing or hammer candlestick. Likewise, the lower high could be signaled when a doji, gravestone or dragonfly candlestick is printed. Moreover, the lower lows and lower highs often take place at resistance and support levels. In a downtrend the \"trend is your friend\" until its not and in a downtrend, there are ways for both bullish and bearish traders to participate in the stock: Bearish traders who are already holding a position in a stock can feel confident the downtrend will continue unless the stock makes a higher high. Traders looking to take a position in a stock trading in a downtrend can usually find the safest entry on the lower high. Bullish traders can enter the trade on the lower low and exit on the lower high. These traders can also enter when the downtrend breaks and the stock makes a higher high indicating a reversal into an uptrend may be in the cards. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge!

The Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum entered downtrends during the last half of February, and each crypto has been making a series of lower highs and lower lows. Bitcoins most recent lower high was formed on Wednesday at $23,999 and the most recent confirmed lower low was printed at the $22,520 mark on Feb. 24, while Ethereums most recent lower high was created on Thursday at $1,678 and the most recent confirmed lower low was formed at the $1,557 mark on Feb. 25. If the two cryptos close near their low-of-day, Bitcoin and Ethereum will print bearish Marubozu candlesticks, which could indicate lower prices will come again on Saturday. The next most likely scenario is that they will form inside bar patterns to begin to consolidate Fridays move lower, which will lean bearish for continuation. Bitcoin has resistance above at $22,729 and $24.206 and support below at $21,313 and $20,545. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,564 and $1,717 and support below at $1,421 and $1,308.

The crypto's most recent lower high was created on Tuesday at $0.083 and the most recent confirmed lower low was printed at the $0.078 mark on Feb.25. During Fridays 24-hour trading session, Dogecoin was trying to bounce up from the low-of-day to print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come on Saturday. The next most likely scenario, as with Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that Dogecoin will start to consolidate sideways. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and $0.091 and support below at $0.075 and at 7 cents.

While decentralized perpetual exchange GMX (CRYPTO: GMX) leads the ecosystem, a rising star has been capturing attention in the form of Gains Network (CRYPTO: GNS). Gains Network has been gaining traction with its gTrade perpetual futures exchange, which offers leverage trading on multiple asset classes, cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital said in a research report. Gains Network borrows concepts from the MakerDAO model to offer synthetic leverage trading with greater capital efficiency, similar to Synthetix. Users can stake GNS to receive platform fees paid in DAI, allowing them to deliver real yield without relying on token emissions. With Gains, gDAI liquidity providers (LPs) act as trader counterparties as vault depositors supply DAI to earn yield from trading fees and liquidations. GNS acts as a backstop while earning a portion of trader losses. Also Read:Is Silvergate's Fall Certain? Industry Experts React To This Cryptocurrency Bank's Problems Gains can undercut GMX on fees partly due to the simple nature of the relationship between traders and LPs. GMX's lack of restrictions combined with its spot asset usage makes it ideal for integrations with many promising dApps. However, after being dwarfed by GMX margin volume for most of 2022, Gains Network has nearly reached parity with GMX since its Arbitrum launch. GMX still has the edge, especially considering that the Gains Network volume shown includes Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC) data as well. Gains Network's emphasis on sustainable token economics has helped fuel its growth, which is reflected in its ranking as the fourth-highest protocol earnings in all of the cryptocurrencies over the past six months, the report further stated. Arbitrum's thriving DeFi ecosystem has started luring established projects from other chains, and Gains Network is one of these projects that has been successfully deployed on Polygon.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.

Here's a look at what the charts indicate about crucial levels for these tokens: 1. Bitcoin: The daily chart of Bitcoin shows the token has declined after nudging a crucial resistance close to the $25,200 level. The level is important because the cryptocurrency tried to nudge the level back in August 2022. However, it failed to breach the mark on the upside and initiated a downward trend, hitting close to the $15,600 level by Nov. 2022. As the token witnesses a sell-off, the next support will be close to the $21,500 level. If this mark is breached, levels close to $18,400 could be tested. Source: Trading View 2.

Issuers stand to gain from increased revenue from settlement and exchange fees, as well as new payment data opportunities. They could also see increased investment profits due to more bank deposit accounts. Meanwhile, users could benefit from significantly reduced settlement and remittance fees, seamless support for foreign currency payments, including USD-pegged stablecoins, and the ability to use assets as a means of exchange for other digital assets like NFTs. \"We will experiment to ensure that each bank can issue its own stablecoin that can be used in Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask while complying with Japans new fund settlement laws,\" a press release issued on Thursday stated.

Ethereums most recent confirmed lower low was created on Wednesday at $1,594 and the most recent lower high was formed at the $1,679 mark on Thursday. During Fridays 24-hour trading session, Bitcoin and Ethereum were working to print hammer candlesticks on the daily chart, with long lower wicks. Hammer candlesticks, when found in a downtrend, can indicate the next lower low is in and the stock or crypto will trade higher the following trading day. The second most likely scenario is that Bitcoin and Ethereum will trade sideways to consolidate Fridays sharp decrease. If that happens, traders can watch for the cryptos to print a possible inside bar pattern, or a series of inside bars over the weekend. Bitcoin has resistance above at $24,206 and $25,288 and support below at $22,719 and $21,313. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,717 and $1,957 and support below at $1,564 and $1,421.

Dogecoinis trading in a downtrend, with the most recent lower high formed on Wednesday at $0.089 and the most recent confirmed lower low printed at the $0.082 level on that same day. The drop on Friday caused Dogecoin to break down bearishly from a triangle formation, which may spook bullish investors. If Dogecoin continues to slide over the weekend, the crypto may find support at the 200-day simple moving average and reverse course off that level.

But its technical fundamentals remained strong despite the collapse of FTX, which had an inordinate impact on the blockchain's ecosystem, according to a recent research report by Coinbase. What Happened: The Solana community was just as surprised as the broader market by the collapse of FTX, given the network's historical relationship with the now-defunct exchange. Nevertheless, Solana's founder Anatoly Yakovenko believedthe blockchain's \"perceived linkages\" with FTX hadhistorically been overstated.

Solana is well positioned to reassert itself as a genuine layer 1 competitor, given the ecosystem's relative strength in terms of network activity with regard to transactions, users, and development. Why It Matters: Solana's activity on these fronts is favorable compared to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), suggesting the Solana token may be undervalued relative to Ethereum. The report also notedSolana's market capitalization was only around 4.3% of Ethereum's, while the amount of daily active users on the blockchain represents around 43.7% of Ethereum's daily active user base. Additionally, Solana processes around 17 times the number of daily transactions processed by Ethereum.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space.

Despite some volatility, Shiba Inu has been trading in a consolidation since Feb. 6. The consolidation and has settled Shiba Inu into a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. A symmetrical triangle pattern is created when a stock forms a series of lower highs and higher lows between a descending and an ascending trendline, which meet on the right side of the chart to form an apex. The pattern indicates that the bulls and bears are equally in control. A symmetrical triangle is often formed on lower-than-average volume and demonstrates a decrease in volatility, indicating consolidation. The decreasing volume is often followed by a sharp increase in volume when the stock breaks up or down from the pattern, which should happen before the stock reaches the apex of the triangle. Aggressive bullish traders may choose to purchase a stock in a symmetrical triangle when the security reverses course on the lower ascending trendline, with a stop set if the stock rejects at the upper descending trendline of the pattern. More conservative traders may wait for the stock to break up bullishly from the pattern on higher-than-average volume. Aggressive bearish traders may choose to trade opposite to the bulls, entering into a short position on a rejection of the upper descending trendline and covering the position if the stock finds support at the lower trendline. Opposite to the bulls, conservative bearish traders may wait for the stock to break down from the lower trendline on higher-than-average bearish volume. The Shiba Inu Chart: Shiba Inu started to develop its symmetrical triangle on Feb. 6, although the crypto had been holding above the lower ascending trendline of the pattern since Jan. 18. Shiba Inu is set to meet the apex of the triangle on March 4 and traders and investors can watch for the crypto to break up or down from the triangle on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction. The consolidation is taking place above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) and on Feb. 14, the 50-day SMA crossed above the 200-day SMA, which caused a golden cross to form. Its considered healthy for a stock or crypto to consolidate for a period of time after having a number of major technical indicators suggest a change in sentiment. The sideways consolidation has caused Shiba Inus relative strength index (RSI) to drop down to a comfortable 54% level from the 82% level on Feb. 4. When a stock or cryptos RSI measures in between 30% to 70%, it indicates there is room for the price to move without it becoming overbought or oversold.

The goal of the project is to bring the RMS Titanic and its physical artifacts to the public on a global scale, the South China Morning Post reported. Artifact Labs intends to create NFTs of 5,500 artifacts already retrieved from the wreck and any future artifacts. It will also introduce the Titanic DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) so that members can participate in future projects.

This collaboration between RMS Titanic, owned by Premier Acquisition Holdings, and two Hong Kong-based firms, is significant as Hong Kong intends to become a regional hub for virtual assets. The launch of the Titanic DAO will provide a platform for members to engage in future initiatives. Recently, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong announced that retail investors would be allowed to purchase virtual assets with significant market capitalization, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), on authorized platforms. These new regulations will take effect in June. The new regulations cover various types of virtual assets, not just cryptocurrencies, and it aims to help Hong Kong become a more prominent player in Web3. The push for virtual assets has been a significant focus in Hong Kong since the collapse of FTX, which was once the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Robinhood: The daily chart of Robinhood shows the stock is trading inside a triangular pattern with the range narrowing over time. The stock is likely to remain in this range for a few more weeksbefore a breakout can be expected. If the stock breaks out of the upper blue line as shown in the chart, that would indicate a good entry point to ride the rally. The next resistance for the stock can be expected close to the $16 level. Source: Trading View 2. Coinbase: The daily chart of Coinbase shows the stock trading with a descending wedge pattern. The stock may continue within this short range for some more time to come before a breakout or breakdown occurs. However, the stock has been forming lower lows on the daily chart, which is not an encouraging sign for the long term. After hitting a short-term high of close to $87 in early February, the stock formed a lower high of about $73 last week.

At the same time, Ohanian practices what is called self-custody, which requires him to be directly responsible for managing the passwords, or private keys, of his most valuable possessions.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The crypto has been trading mostly within its Feb. 16 trading range since that date, on generally decreasing volume, which indicates Bitcoin is in a period of consolidation. The consolidation has caused Bitcoins relative strength index (RSI) to cool down from being in overbought territory, which could give the crypto the power needed to reclaim the $25,000 level as support. If that happens, the bearish divergence, which has been developing since Jan. 14 will correct. The bearish divergence may concern bullish traders, however, and could give bears the upper hand if the crypto breaks down from its sideways trading pattern. Bearish divergence occurs when a stock or crypto makes higher highs while its RSI makes a series of lower lows. If Bitcoin breaks up above the $25,000 mark, it may find resistance at the next Fibonacci extension level at about $26,400, which aligns with the golden pocket. Bitcoin has resistance above at $25,288 and $25,772 and support below at $24,206 and $22,729.

Similarly, $1,000 invested in Doges closing price of $0.088208 would fetch 11,337 Dogecoin.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space.

Data provided by Glassnode", "Hong Kong's securities watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), has proposed a policy that will allow retail investors to trade in large-cap cryptocurrency tokens, such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), through licensed virtual-asset platforms. This move aims to provide regulatory oversight and investor protections to cryptocurrency investment activities that were once vibrant but unregulated, the South China Morning Post reported. The virtual-asset platforms that will be licensed through the new cryptocurrency regulatory regime, effective from June1 this year, can offer only \"eligible large-cap virtual assets\" to retail investors. These assets should be included in at least two acceptable indices issued by at least two independent index providers, the SFC said. The consultation period for the policy will end on March31. The SFC's consultation paper comes as governments worldwide begin to regulate the freewheeling cryptocurrency market following a series of meltdowns last year, including that ofFTX (CRYPTO: FTT), previously the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange. According to the SFC, the collapses resulted in substantial losses to tens of millions of investors and exposure risks arising from the \"increasing interconnectedness\" between the virtual-asset market and the traditional financial system. Effective regulation is crucial, the watchdog added. Under the new regime, exchanges can decide which cryptocurrency tokens retail investors can trade and how much they can invest. Before offering these tokens to investors, platforms will need to consider general factors, such as a virtual asset's management team, maturity, and liquidity, and the security infrastructure of its blockchain protocol. Also read:As Bitcoin Hits $25,000 Ceiling, Experts Say Investors Turning To Crypto As A Safe Haven The platforms will also need to conduct knowledge assessments on investors before serving them, and set exposure limits for customers depending on their financial situations. They will also set up token admission and review committees, which will be responsible for following through with the SFC's admission criteria and making final decisions on whether to admit, halt, suspend, or withdraw offerings. Hong Kong has recently made a major push to become a virtual-asset hub, with policies unveiled last year legalizing retail access to cryptocurrency trading. In December2022, the city passed the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill, which introduced the new virtual-asset platform licensing regime. After June1, unlicensed cryptocurrency trading activity will be a criminal offense, the SFC said. Hong Kong has taken a conservative stance towards cryptocurrencies since 2018, limiting cryptocurrency trading on licensed exchanges to professional investors  individuals with a portfolio of at least HKD8 million ($1 million).

The apex crypto's value began to increase again in January and continued to do so over the course of the month. The last time BTC's value was around $25,000 was in mid-June of last year, after which itdroppedto a range of $19,000 to $21,000 where it remained stagnant for several months. Image: CoinGecko Industry veterans believe that the proliferation of businesses and merchants embracing BTC as a viable payment option is a crucial factor in the surging valuation of thecryptocurrency. According to the experts, the surge in BTC's price has made it an attractive option for those who are skeptical of traditional financial institutions. Azra Kojadinovic, President of, the Serbia Chapter says the recent surge in BTC prices has sparked renewed interest in cryptocurrencies, and it is likely that this trend will continue in the future. BTC's long-term outlook remains positive, and ETH'sincreasing popularity as a platform for creating dApps is driving its growth. As the adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to increase, the future of the cryptocurrency market looks bright, Kojadinovic said. According to Whitney Setiawan, research analyst at crypto exchange Bitrue, along with BTC's rise, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has also breached $1,700 for the first time in more than 3 months. While enthusiasm is high, we may see long-term holders taking their gains, leading to a somewhat visible negative correction in short to mid-term. However, this recent upsurge has shown that the industry is becoming somewhat immune to negative regulatory pressures, and investors are taking positions that could change their bottom line in the future, Setiawan said. Also read:NBA Hall Of Famer Paul Pierce Made $195M Playing Basketball: Now He'll Pay This Much To Settle SEC Crypto Promotion Case Jenny Zheng, BD Lead, Bybit Web3 says with the proliferation of businesses and merchants embracing BTC as a viable payment option, the demand for the cryptocurrency has experienced a marked increase, thereby propelling its value upwards. This groundswell of adoption is further reinforced by the rising prevalence of BTC wallets, indicating a mounting number of individuals purchasing and retaining BTC as a secure store of value or investment vehicle. The recent trend of generating BTC non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is expected to exert additional pressure on adopting BTC, according to Zheng. The surge in BTC price is not solely attributed to its intrinsic value but is also heavily influenced by the current global economic climate. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic has caused economic turmoil, resulting in market volatility and leaving investors with a sense of insecurity. Anndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain expert, says investors, in response, are increasingly turning to alternative investments that offer a hedge against inflation and economic instability. BTC is viewed by many as a safe haven asset, and its decentralized nature makes it an attractive option for those skeptical of traditional financial institutions, he says.

The Bitcoin Chart: Although Bitcoin negated its downtrend on Wednesday by surging almost 10% to form a higher high, the crypto hasnt yet confirmed a new uptrend by printing a higher low. If the crypto surges up above Wednesdays $25,256 high-of-day over the next few days, Fridays low-of-day will serve as the higher low and confirm the new trend. Traders and investors may have seen the massive reversal to the upside on the horizon because on Monday, Bitcoin bounced up of the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. The area is a strong support level and holding above the area may have acted as a bullish signal. Bullish traders want to see Bitcoin surge higher over the next few days or continue to trade sideways, possibly forming inside bar patterns, in order to gain the strength to make a higher high into next week. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down under the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could indicate the current bull run is over. Bitcoin has resistance above at $25,772 and $29,321 and support below at $24,206 and $22,729. The Ethereum Chart: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum negated its downtrend but on Thursday, by forming a higher high of $1,742.50, which was above the most recent lower high of $1,699.66. If Ethereum surges higher over the next few days, Fridays low-of-day will serve as the higher low and confirm an uptrend. On Monday, Ethereum dropped to back-test the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) as support, which was healthy. On Tuesday, big bullish volume came in and pushed Ethereum up through the eight-day and 21-day EMAs, which indicates the bulls are in control. Bullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Ethereum up over $1,750 to confirm a new uptrend is in the cards. Bearish traders want to see the crypto break down under the eight-day EMA. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,717 and $1,957 and support below at $1,564 and $1,421. The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin is trading in a confirmed uptrend and has made a series of higher highs and higher lows. The cryptos most recent higher low was formed on Monday at $0.079 and the most recent higher high was printed at the $0.091 mark on Thursday. If Dogecoin surges up toward $0.10 over the next few days, Fridays low-of-day will serve as the next higher low within the pattern. If the crypto tops out under that level, a lower high will occur and Dogecoin may start forming a downtrend. Bullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Dogecoin up to form a higher high or for the crypto to continue trading sideways, which would lean bullish for continuation. Bearish traders want to see Dogecoin fall back under the eight-day EMA, which could hand power over to the bears. Dogeoin has resistance above at $0.091 and $0.099 and support below at $0.083 and $0.075.

Left issued a new short report on Etsy Thursday and shared some details on Twitter as to why the e-commerce company could be in trouble. Etsy has become one of the largest platforms in the world for counterfeit goods, and it is indisputable. Citron said Etsy risks trouble with the FTC, DOJ, SEC, Customs and Border Protection and the brands the short seller alleges have trademarks being stolen. Citron said Etsy may have previously been able to claim that counterfeit products were a small percent of revenue, but that isnt the case anymore as the scale has become too large and abusive. The worst part is they have allowed the culprits to buy ad words of the brands and then labeled many of these counterfeiters as trusted websites. DIS), NKE) LVMUY).

Citron said it is fair to assume that Etsy knows about the problem and either turns a blind eye to it, or worse, knowingly, sells advertising and credibility to the violators. In the short report, Citron said Etsy would likely say that it has kicked off past users for violations and counterfeit sales are a small portion of its revenue. We have no doubt that Etsy is about to face a barrage of bad press that highlights this behavior and compromises the integrity of the platform. A Poem For Etsy: Taking things a step further, Citron had ChatGPT write a poem using Etsy and Citron in the style of Shakespeare. Hark! Doth mine ears deceive me? Forsooth, tis a tale most foul! Etsy, that once-beloved purveyor of goods crafted by hand, hath fallen from grace and been revealed as a nefarious den of iniquity. Read the full poem here.

Unprofitable high-growth names are back in favor to start the year, but several of the biggest movers don't really fit into the growth category. Those names are usually termed \"meme stocks\"  a basket of companies that have developed a strong following from retail traders and are toutedacross social media platforms. As Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY) prepared for potential bankruptcy at the start of the year, the stock soared as traders latched onto high short interest in the name. Carvana Co (NYSE:CVNA) is up more than 100% since the turn of the calendar page and Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ:BYND) is up more than 40%in the face of Jim Chanos' warning that both companies are headed for bankruptcy. Check This Out:Jim Chanos Says Tesla Is An Overhyped 'Chinese Car Company,' Carvana, Beyond Meat Are Going Bankrupt: Why The 'Nirvana' Won't Last A lot of the retail crowd likes to target heavily shorted stocks in an effort to induceshort squeezes. That's been one of the main plays in the playbook ever since several retail traders banded together on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets in early 2021 and sparked a massive short squeeze inoriginal meme stocks,AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (NYSE:AMC) andGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME). Both of these names are upsignificantly to start the year, with AMC leading the way, trading more than 30% higher. Gamestop is up close to 20%. The short-squeeze play was successful in this duobecause the majority of the retail traders involved were only focused on these two names. Now with so many speculative bets being made on anything that looks like it can make a massive move, the retail group isn't concentrated enough to repeat the craze from two years ago. Such is evidenced by the wide array of names that seem to move for no good reason. Although most can't hold the gains, many stocksare skyrocketing for days or weeks at a time. MSFT)-backed took the world by storm. Once people got a taste of what AI could do, they started bidding up stocks with \"AI\" in their names.

Risky Coins In Favor:Crypto coins have held up well in 2023, especially considering the collapase of FTX late last year and the ongoing saga of the face of the once fast-growing firm, Sam Bankman-Fried. Interestingly enough, some of the smaller, more riskycoins seem to be the ones in favor.

SPCE) is up 80% year-to-date, SIDU) climbed 30% just this week and RDW) has skyrocketed close to 90%. Benzinga's Take: The retail crowd seems to be back in full force, but the dispersion is leading to short-lived moves. As traders continue to try to be among the first in names to rocket higher, they are more quickly booking profits and searching for the next opportunity. The retail crowd's dollars are spread thin, but don't count them out. Despite calls from several big names that the retail crowd was just a symptom of restlessness during the pandemic, it appears the pool of individualtraders ishere to stay. When their efforts are aligned, we've seen they can make quite the splash.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -13.19%. Data provided by Glassnode", "An analysis of the profitability of Ethereum staking by Binance Research has revealed that a significant minority of Ether (CRYPTO: ETH)holders who have staked their ETH in Ethereum's Beacon Chain over the past three years are currently in profit, according to a Coindesk report. The majority are underwater. Ethereum staking is a form of passive investing, where users lock their ETH tokens to validate transactions in return for an annualized staking yield of approximately 4%. Also read:Power Of The Dog? Elon Musk's Canine Tweet Has Traders Howling: The Latest On Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Floki Since Beacon Chain went live in December 2020, over 16.5 million Ether, worth $27.7 billion, have been staked. According to Binance Research, 31% or 5.115 million ETH are in profit, while the remaining 11.385 million ETH are in loss. In this context, loss indicates that the going market rate of ether is currently lower than when they were locked in the Beacon Chain. Binance Research's analysis is relevant at a time when the market is trying to predict potential selling pressure after Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade, set to take place in mid-March, which is anticipated to open withdrawals of staked ETH. Those who are underwater may have little incentive to liquidate their holdings after the upgrade, while those in profit are likely to hold onto their assets. The report noted that around 2 million ETH were staked at prices ranging from $400 to 700, which represents the earliest stakers in December2020. This group is likely illiquid given that liquid staking was far less known at the time. However, they are currently at profit, and are probably some of the strongest believers in Ethereum, according to Binance Research. Notably, the whole staking balance cannot be withdrawn on the day of the upgrade, and only 43,200 ETH can be unstaked daily. Nevertheless, the total staking reward earned, which is approximately 1 million ETH, can be withdrawn instantly, according to Saxo Bank.

Of the 40,521 tokens that did gain traction, 9902, or 24%, saw a 90% price decrease within a week after launch, indicating their involvement in pump-and-dump schemes. Chainalysis also discovered that the same fraudsters were responsible for multiple scams in the previous year. The most active individual launched 264 suspect tokens in 2022. \"We estimate that the creators of these tokens made a total of $30m in profits from selling off their holdings before the tokens value plummeted,\" the report stated. Chainalysis found that 445 individuals or groups accounted for 24% of the 9,902 suspected pump and dump tokens launched in 2022. Despite the fact that the amount of cryptocurrency used in purchasing these tokens is insignificant when compared to the trillions of dollars in crypto transactions in the previous year, the report states that it still causes substantial damage to unsuspecting investors.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Data provided by Glassnode", "The Securities and Exchange Commission's direction to Paxos to cease issuing new units of Binance's dollar-pegged cryptocurrency Binance USD (CRYPTO: BUSD), has triggered reactions from industry experts, who believe that staking yield should not be considered a security. Slava Demchuck, CEO of AMLBot stated that stablecoin issuer Circle (CRYPTO: USDC) currently has the most advanced compliance framework built into the USDC token, which he believes will lead to fewer regulatory hurdles in the future. However, he added that the other mentioned tokens can expect constant attacks and significant fines, as seen with Tether (CRYPTO: USDT). Demchuck also predicted that stablecoins will either have to fit a clear paradigm set by regulators or face being shut down. Stanislav Havryliuk, COO at Zonda stated that the SECs increased pressure on the crypto market is due to the recent FTX (CRYPTO: FTT) situation. He added that reaching an agreement between U.S. regulators and the crypto industry may take some time, but the outcome will ultimately benefit all parties involved, with safety as a priority. Havryliuk also noted that USDC is the safest stablecoin due to its rigorous auditing and licensing requirements, and it covers more networks than BUSD, so he expects regulators to treat them differently. Chen Zhuling, founder and CEO of RockX, a staking solutions provider, disagrees with the SECs decision, arguing that staking yield should not be considered a security and that staking helps to maintain the blockchain and incentivizes users with tokens. Also read:FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Barred From Using VPNs While Out On Bail Zhuling also noted that US-based platforms may switch to a non-custodial staking model, and this decision could help to reduce centralization across Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and other PoS networks. He also predicted that Asian staking providers will have a unique opportunity to offer more sustainable solutions and innovations in the space. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao on Monday confirmed that Paxos was directed by New York's statefinancial regulator to stop creating new BUSD stablecoins. However, Paxos indicated that its own stablecoin was not impacted, but it did receive notification of potential charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its BUSD product. This regulatory move is the latest attempt to control the once-unregulated cryptocurrency industry.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Data provided by Glassnode", "Coinbase Global, Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) popped up over 4% at one point on Tuesday after consumer price index data released by the U.S. Labor Department showed inflation ticked lower in January. Inflation rose 6.4% last month compared to 6.5% in December, which caused Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) to spike up over 2% and 4%, respectively, although the number came in above the 6.2% expected by economists. The S&P 500 initially edged about 0.5% higher in reaction to the data before dropping under Mondays closing price. By 10:30 a.m. the stock market and crypto sector had erased the pump higher, which pressured Coinbase down to near flat. From a technical analysis standpoint, Coinbase rejected the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) when it moved higher, indicating the stock needs further consolidation under that level before making another attempt to regain the area. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Coinbase Chart: Coinbase also attempted to regain the 200-day SMA on Friday and failed. The 200-day SMA is an important bellwether indicator that acts as a major area of support and resistance, making it difficult for a stock to break through the area and remain above it on the first few attempts. Coinbase has been trading near to the 200-day since Jan. 27, briefly breaking above the area on Feb. 2 before dropping under the level on Feb. 9. When Coinbase fell under the 200-day SMA, the stock also confirmed a new downtrend was intact by printing a lower low. Coinbases most recent lower high was formed on Feb. 8 at $73.97 and the most recent confirmed lower low was printed on Monday at $53.66. If Coinbase trades lower on Wednesday, Tuesdays high-of-day will serve as the next higher low within the pattern. If Coinbase closes the trading day under the $58 mark, the stock will print a shooting star candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come again on Wednesday. If that happens, the stock may find support at the 50-day SMA, which is trending at about $48. Bullish traders want to see Coinbase chop sideways near to the 200-day SMA and then for big bullish volume to come in and break the stock up above the level. The 50-day SMA is curling up, which is a good sign for the bulls. Coinbase has resistance above at $60.99 and $83.32 and support below at $50.34 and $40.15.

Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) was showing relative strength, popping up slightly in an attempt to regain the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) as support. All three cryptos suffered bearish price action during Thursdays 24-hour trading session, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin plunging over 5%, 6% and 9%, respectively, as fears the rising U.S. dollar could be signaling a recession gripped investors.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum negated their uptrends on Wednesday by printing lower highs and on Thursday confirmed downtrends by forming lower lows. Bitcoins most recent lower high is at the $23,451 mark and Ethereums is at $1,699. Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has shown evidence that their next lower lowshaveoccurred and traders and investors will be watching to see if the cryptos show any reversal signals into the weekend. If Bitcoin and Ethereum close Fridays session flat or at their high-of-day, they will print a doji or hammer candlestick, respectively, which could indicate a bounce will come on Saturday. A golden cross formed on Bitcoins and Ethereums chart this week, which may give bullish traders more confidence going forward. A golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA and those levels may provide support if Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to fall further. Bitcoin has resistance above at $22,729 and $24,206 and support below at $21,313 and $20,545. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,564 and $1,717 and support below at $1,421. The Dogecoin Chart: Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin confirmed a new downtrend on Thursday by printing falling under its most recent higher low after printing a lower high. Dogecoins most recent lower high was created on Wednesday at $0.093. During Fridays 24-hour trading session, Dogecoin was trading in an inside bar pattern, with all of the price action taking place within Thursdays range. The pattern leans bearish in this case because Dogecoin is in a downtrend and because the inside bar was forming at the bottom of Thursdays trading range. Traders and investors can watch for Dogecoin to break up or down from the mother bar later on Friday or over the weekend to gauge future direction, otherwise, the crypto may continue to chop sideways. If Dogecoin breaks bearishly, the crypto is likely to find support at the 200-day SMA. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and $0.091 and support below at $0.075 and at the 7-cent mark.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -11.24%. Data provided by Glassnode", "What happened: An Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) whale sent $37,124,620 worth of Ethereum off Bitstamp. The ETH address associated with this transaction has been identified as: 0x48ec5560bfd59b95859965cce48cc244cfdf6b0c Why it matters: Whales typically send cryptocurrency from exchanges when planning to hold their investments for an extended period of time. Storing large amounts of money on an exchange presents an additional risk of theft, as exchange wallets are the most sought-after target for cryptocurrency hackers. Ethereum whales that run their own validator nodes (costing 32 ETH each) must send their Ether to the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is then locked up until the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. According to Glassnode, only 16.19% of the total supply remains liquid across all centralized exchanges. The removal of ETH from an exchange reduces potential sell side pressure, allowing the price of Ether to increase more easily.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity. It's unlikely that the investor plans to hold their crypto on Coinbase, as the security risks of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange are higher than holding these assets in a hardware wallet. It's likely that this Bitcoin whale is planning either on selling Ethereum or trading it for other altcoins. Price Action: Ethereum is down -1% in the past 24 hours.

What Happened: Major coins traded in the red on Wednesday following rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission would be getting \"rid\" of cryptocurrency staking in the U.S for retail customers. See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin: As the week approaches to a close, professional traders seem to be betting that Bitcoin is unlikely to breach and stay above the $23,400-level by Friday. Options data indicates maximum open interest on the Call side is concentrated in the range of $23,000-23,500 mark. This shows that professional traders are expecting Bitcoin to stay at or below these levels on Friday. This is because unlike retail traders, professional market participants are known to prefer writing (shorting) options and collecting premiums rather than buying them. The probability of making profits too is higher while writing options. Meanwhile, on the downside, the $22,500-mark seems to be acting as a near-term support. If the cryptocurrency breaches this level on the downside, the next support comes between $21,500 and $22,000 mark. Ethereum: For Ethereum, the $1,750-mark acts as a near term resistance while the $1,600 level acts as the near term support. It is noteworthy that open interest levels only provide a fair idea about support, resistance levels anticipated by the market and any major news-flow or event could lead to rapid movement in prices and a subsequent shift in open interest levels.

The NFTs will also provide additional benefits and could help launch New Orleans as a Web3 hub. What Happened: Web3 venture studio NieuxCohelped transform the historic landmark The Eiffel.\" Now known as The Nieux, the building serves as a campus connecting peoplewith Web3 efforts.

While some Web3 projects launch NFTs to make money, Williamson says NieuxCo aims to bring the communitytogether and grow Web3 tech across the city. Williamson spent years in the media and connected with other entrepreneurs who saw Web3 as an opportunity for New Orleans. Ive fortunately and unfortunately been at the front end of a couple of disruptions within the market and a few front ends of innovation, Williamson said. Weve been managing and engaging with this communitythe last 15 years.

The NFTs were generated using artificial intelligence (AI) to showcase what Mardi Gras means to them. The group wanted to experiment with DALL-E, a unit of ChatGPT parent OpenAI, which can turn text into images. I dont know how we would have done this without AI tools,\" Williamson said. The goal was to allow the community to have a collective vision and use AI to help along the way. Were intrigued by AI and connecting communities. Its not the technology as much as how people are going to use it. Holding an NFT from the collection acts as a passport to the Nieux Homebase at 2040 St. Charles Avenue and events. Mardi Gras Access: Williamson stressed the importance of having a home base and being so close to the Mardi Gras action. We literally have a front-row seat to Mardi Gras,\" he said. The hub offered to NFT holders is right on the Mardi Gras parade route. And anyone who has ever been to the Mardi Gras parade knows that a home base with bars and bathrooms is extremely valuable. When asked about those businesses and people criticizing Williamson and the organization for charging for bathrooms, Williamson said the concept is nothing new. Access to bars and bathrooms is not a new idea,\" he says. \"Doing it with NFTs is new. You get to walk by, walk in and have a place to hang out. Web3 Growth in New Orleans: Mardi Gras NFTs are a way to help people see the utility offered with the hub and as a way to test out what an NFT is, Williamson explains. The entrepreneur also believes New Orleans needs to be at the forefront of the Web3 conversation. New Orleans is one of the most creative cities in the world,\" Williamson says, believing the emerging technology will help artists become more creative and New Orleans Increased utility cases are being made for NFTs for items like restaurants and music festivals, too. \"The idea of having an NFT to be a ticket to get in, hopefully, allows people to test out what an NFT is,\" he says. I would argue New Orleans is one of the greatest communities, most connected communities in the world who else has a Mardi Gras thats lasted for a hundred years? What's Next: The NFT will also have benefits once Mardi Gras ends, including more events and an ongoing subscription service that grants a right of refusal in the next year. Could be annual as long as you hold the NFT. Not a one-time access to home base. New Orleans will host the Super Bowl in 2025  another event Williamson thinks Web3 tech could play a role in.

Here's a look at Cowen's take onwhat it means for themarkets. What To Know: The State of the Union provides insights into the president's priorities over the year ahead. Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg broke down the implications Wednesday in a new note to clients. Biden saidthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done an excellent job in its fight against \"junk fees.\" His speech included praise for the agency's proposal to cut back on late fees forcredit cards, Seiberg said. \"We are dubious Congress will enact the President's bill to curb other junk fees, but we believe the CFPB is likely to keep the pressure on the banks. That means continued focus on overdraft fees and new risk for ATM fees, foreign exchange fees, and wire transfer fees,\" the Cowen analyst said. Related Link:Biden Spotlights Job Creation, Bi-Partisanship In State Of Union To Divided Congress Biden also called on Congressto raise the stock buyback tax because the presentrates are not high enough to discourage public companies from engaging in buybacks, Seiberg said. Although Cowen doesn't think the higher buyback tax will ever get enough support fromHouse Republicans to pass, the firm noted that it's not a zero-probability event. The president also urged the opposing party to raise the debt ceiling, noting that no one wants theU.S. to default on its bills. He also stayed firm in his reluctance to accept cuts to Social Security or Medicare. \"We believe this reflects the challenge ahead. It is easy to call for spending cuts in exchange for a debt ceiling hike. It is harder to make those cuts actually occur,\" Seiberg said. Cowen pointed out that nothing was said in the way of crypto. Although this was surprising given the ongoing FTX fiasco, Cowen took it as a reminder that crypto isn't a \"top tier issue politically.\" SPY Price Action: TheSPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) is trading down 0.93% in the wake of theState of the Union address.

The source of these funds and how they were accessed has become a major point of concern, causing many to question the actions of law enforcement agencies, according to a Cointelegraph report. The Alameda wallet address \"brokenfish.eth\" transferred nearly $2 million inFTT tokens from the BentoBox smart contract on SushiSwap. The smart contract, which serves as the central vault for the entire Sushi ecosystem, was previously overseen by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The \"Alameda Research 4\" wallet bought over 1million FTT, valued at roughly $2.3 million, in the $1.86 to $1.87 range, and also opened a loan position on Abracadabra. This wallet is mortgaging 73,000 FTT and $31,000.

Heres a look at how much money people who got in at the start have made. What Happened: Shiba Inu launched in August 2020 as a similarly themed cryptocurrency to Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE).The coin has quickly gained a following and is now one of the 15 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Shiba Inu leverages the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) network and has created a decentralized exchange called ShibaSwap. Three tokens are native to the platform: SHIB, Leash and Bone. A Shiba-Inu based NFT project called Shiboshis launched in November 2021. Formerly only available on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Shiba Inu has been added to several major cryptocurrency platforms including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood.

One scammer was recently caught by the FBI, resulting in the agency becomingthe proud owner of NFTs from two of the most well-known collections. What Happened: Self-proclaimed on-chain sleuth ZachXBT is among the people on Twitter that are analyzing on-chain crypto data to find red flags and call out scams that are happening. A recent post from ZachXBT highlighted the FBI catching someone who previously hacked several prominent NFT personalities' Twitter accounts, including artist Beeple. Twitter accounts for Beeple, JenkinstheValet, Franklinisbored, Zeneca and the NounsDAO were among those that were hacked by the scammer known as Horror, also known as Chase Senecal, according to the report. Since a thread was posted by ZachXBT exposing the crime, the FBI has seized cryptocurrency, a $14,000 watch and several NFTs from the scammer. According to the report, the FBI seized 86.5678 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT and a Doodles NFT. Heres a look at the NFTs in question.

What Happened: The transaction was settled via an NFT marketplace on the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchainbuilt by Origin Protocol. Teller Protocol, a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending platform, provided flexible asset-based lending options for the real estate transaction. The company said it isthe second sale of a rental property via NFT enabled by Roofstock onChain. Roofstock onChain links home ownership to NFTs by holding each property in a limited liability company, which is then wrapped in aNFT on Ethereum, referred to as a Unique Home onChain. The entire transaction, from financing to title ownership, takesplace peer-to-peer on the Ethereumblockchain. Buyers can also seek financing for the NFT property purchase through USDC (CRYPTO: USDC) Homes, a DeFi lending marketplace built on the Teller Protocol. Sanjay Raghavan, head of Web3 Initiatives at Roofstock onChain, added, Buyers and sellers can benefit from instantaneous sale and settlement of rental properties, with flexible asset-based DeFi leverage options, all while maintaining transparency and security in the transaction process.

Once a lender funds the borrowers request, the USDC Homes protocol uses funds to purchase the LLC NFT and transfer it to a smart contract escrow vault until the borrower pays back the entire loan plus interest. Why It Matters: Matthew Liu, the co-founder of Origin Protocol, said, Non-fungible tokens are quickly gaining fresh utility while most of the world is no longer watching. As decentralized solutions begin impacting traditional industries to a greater degree, users will begin adopting the technology to reap the benefits of NFTs. In the case of real estate, transactions will become much cheaper, more transparent, and far quicker through the use of blockchain.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were also trading near their closing price on Thursday, in tandem with the apex crypto. On Thursday, Bitcoin and Ethereum followed the general market higher, breaking up above the previous days high before falling to close flat. The S&P 500 advanced 1.47% into the biggest after-hours earnings session of the season but began to decline after Apple and Alphabet printed results that came in below analyst estimates and Amazon posted mixed results, which also weighed on the crypto sector. Despite Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin trading stubbornly near to flat, the three cryptos are trading in slight uptrends, which is bullish although traders, especially in the crypto sector, often enjoy a higher level of volatility. For volatility to increase, higher volume will need to enter into the crypto sector and if that happens over this weekend, the directional movement in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin could predict how the general market behaves next week. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum reversed into uptrends on Dec. 19 and have been making a consistent series of higher highs and higher lows. Bitcoins most recent higher low was formed on Jan. 30 and $22,500 and the most recent higher high was printed at the $24,262 mark on Thursday; Ethereums most recent higher high was printed at the $1,534 mark on Jan. 30 and the most recent higher high was created on Thursday at $1,714. During Fridays 24-hour trading session, Bitcoin and Ethereum tested the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) as support and held above the level, although Bitcoin was coming close to falling under the eight-day EMA during the afternoon. If either crypto decline below the area, it could be a warning sign for short-term bullish traders. For Bitcoins or Ethereums uptrend to be negated, the cryptos will either have to print a lower low or a lower high. If the uptrend continues, its likely Bitcoin and Ethereum will spike up to print a higher high over the weekend. The second most likely scenario is that the cryptos begin to consolidate sideways, possibly printing inside bar patterns. Bitcoin has resistance above at $24,206 and $25,772 and support below at $22,729 and $21,313. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,717 and $1,957 and support below at $1,564 and $1,421. The Dogecoin Chart: Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is trading in a strong uptrend. Dogecoins most recent higher low was formed on Jan. 30 at $0.084 and the most recent higher high was printed at the $0.097 mark the following day. Dogecoin is trading in a triple inside bar pattern, with all of the last three trading days price action taking place within Tuesdays trading range. The pattern leans slightly bullish in this case because Dogecoin is trading in an uptrend but traders can watch for the crypto to break up or down from the mother bar on higher-than-average volume to determine future direction. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.099 and at 12 cents and support below at $0.091 and $0.083. Read Next:Jack Dorsey's Damus Not Welcome In China: Is Bitcoin Lightning Network To Blame?

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The couch from the original Doge meme, which inspired the Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) logo, is coming to the auction block. Heres how you could own this unique piece of Doge memorabilia. What Happened: In 2021, Dogecoin was one of the trending topicswith the meme crypto surging higher and receiving public mention by Slim Jim, Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and countless others. The cryptocurrency hit all-time highs and was even featured in sketches on Saturday Night Live thanks to the hosting honors of Musk. Many know Dogecoin pays tribute to the Doge meme, which featuredShiba Inu dog Kabosu. It was announced in late 2022 that Kabosu was ill, but has since recovered. PleasrDAO, which purchased the rights to the original Doge meme, is holding an NFTauctionwith the winner receiving ownership of the couch featured in the famous meme image. The original Doge photo from 2010 was purchased in 2021 for 1,696.9 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), or around $4.8 million at the time. PleasrDAO went on to fractionalize the image and NFT. The NFT auction will take place for 24 hours with a kickoff on Feb. 7 at 8:30 p.m. ET followed by a live stream at 7:30 p.m. ET on Feb. 8. The live stream will feature guest appearances by Kabosu and owner Atsuko Sato, who took the iconic photograph. The auction will have five-minute extensions and the live stream will continue until a final bid is hit. The live stream will also feature an open edition non-fungible token drop that will pay tribute to Kabosu and support charity. The idea for the auction came when it was announced Kabosu was sick and PleasrDAO wanted to help with medical bills. The winner of the auction will get an NFT of the couch with a claim for the physical couch. The couch is the original from the meme, but did get a new grey cover to replace the original yellow one from the photo. The auction details say that the Doge smell is included with the couch, no additional charge. The auction winner will have one year to redeem the NFT for the physical couch. Arrangements can be helped by PleasrDAO and will require 60 days notice. Shipping and delivery will be the responsibility of the NFT owner. Related Link: How To Buy Dogecoin Why Its Important: PleasrDAO said the sale of the couch and raising money for charity helps further support the mission of Dogecoin. When we fractionalized the NFT, we started the Own the Doge community, who had developed a very strong relationship with Atsuko, PleasrDAO Head of Marketing Chris Eberle told Decrypt. The Do Only Good Everyday ethos from Dogecoiners really resonates with Atsuko, and the OTD community has donated $2M+ to charities. Eberle said $1 million of the donations have gone to Save the Children, representing its largest crypto donation to date. Proceeds from the couch auction will benefit Save the Children.

If inflation continues to ease at a healthy pace, the bull case for crypto will remain. Bitcoin turned positive as Powell didnt fret over the recent easing of financial conditions.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The general market was also rebounding, with the S&P 500 popping up about 0.5%, which helped to buoy Coinbase higher. Although Coinbase was spiking up over 3%, the stock remains in a short-term consolidation pattern. In Coinbases case, the consolidation is taking place within a double inside bar formation. An inside bar pattern indicates a period of consolidation and is usually followed by a continuation move in the direction of the current trend. An inside bar pattern has more validity on larger time frames (four-hour charts or larger). The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an \"inside bar.\" A double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar. After the break of an inside bar pattern, traders want to watch for high volume for confirmation the pattern was recognized. Bullish traders will want to search for inside bar patterns on stocks that are in an uptrend. Some traders may take a position during the inside bar prior to the break, while other aggressive traders will take a position after the break of the pattern. For bearish traders, finding an inside bar pattern on a stock that's in a downtrend will be key. Like bullish traders, bears have two options of where to take a position to play the break of the pattern. For bearish traders, the pattern is invalidated if the stock rises above the highest range of the mother candle. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Coinbase Chart: On Monday, Coinbase printed an inside bar pattern, trading within Fridays range. On Tuesday, the stock continued to trade within Fridays range, which has settled Coinbase into a double inside bar pattern, which leans bullish because the stock was trading higher before entering into the consolidation pattern. The consolidation has been taking place on decreasing volume, which adds validity to the inside bar pattern. Traders and investors can watch for the stock to eventually break up or down from Fridays candlestick on higher-than-average volume to gauge its future direction and determine that the pattern was recognized. Coinbase is also trading in a confirmed uptrend, making a series of higher highs and higher lows from the $31.55 mark, where the stock began to rebound on Jan. 6. Coinbases most recent higher low was formed on Jan. 25 at $49.60 and the most recent higher high was printed at the 62.29 mark on Friday. If Coinbase breaks up from Fridays mother bar, bullish traders will want to see the stock regain the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) as support, which is trending just above Coinbases share price. Bearish traders want Coinbase to break down from the inside bar pattern or reject from the 200-day SMA if the stock breaks higher. Coinbase has resistance above at $60.99 and $83.32 and support below at $50.34 and $40.15.

Higgins sharedwith Benzinga his lessons learned and what could be next for Web3 in general. Higgins is a featured panelist at Benzingas Future of Crypto in New York City on Dec. 7. History with NFTs, Cryptocurrency: When asked about his history with non-fungible tokens, Higgins knew exactly where he was when he had his first experience. Higgins loves and hates telling the story. Higgins recalledbeing at a dinner with Gary Vaynerchuk (aka Gary Vee) and getting told to buy five CryptoPunks. These little JPEGs called CryptoPunks were going to be huge, Higgins told Benzinga, recalling Vees advice. Instead of buying them, Higgins asked \"Why?\", a move he said every other rational human would have also asked. Digital ownership will be represented on the blockchain. The blockchain will be used for ticketing and on and on. While Higgins began to come around, he still questioned why CryptoPunks, which Vee responded to bysaying that it was because theyre the OG. I ignored it and over the next several months spent time watching the space. Higgins said he hadmade every mistake in the cryptocurrency and NFT sectors and he wasproud of it. This includes being hacked, being rug-pulled and chasing s**tcoins to $0. All that learning is incredibly valuable. I dont regret a single thing. Whats Next for Crypto, NFTs: Higgins said he hadseen this pattern play out before and it wasimportant to be on the edge. Now is the ultimate opportunity with capitulation underway, Higgins told Benzinga. I have never lost sight of how exciting the blockchain is and the potential. Higgins is a fan of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). I do think ETH is the winner, you do want one scalable Layer 1. Higgins said he is shocked at how many people who have earned their battle scars in crypto and NFTs are now capitulating. If you wait for your conviction to be validated by the marketplace before you invest or take action, youll miss your opportunity, he noted.Higgins added that he meantinvesting with time and commitment and not financially, in this case.

When asked who he was excited to hear speak at Future of Crypto, Higgins shared several panelists. I would always pay any amount of money to hear the Mooch (Anthony Scaramucci) speak. Higgins wasalso excited to hear fellow Shark Tank host Kevin OLeary. Higgins served as a guest Shark on the show previously. Mr. Wonderful is always worth the price of admission. Higgins wasalso an investor in Yuga Labs and excited to hear co-founder Greg Solano. Im curious to watch the first real institutional player make their way and what their strategy is. Higgins also lovedinvesting in infrastructure plays such asImmutableX(CRYPTO: IMX), whichwill also be speaking at the event. Higgins has a new book called Burn the Boats coming out on Dec. 14 that looks at the topic of hesitation and hedging instead of going all in. Higgins calledthe book a little bitgenre-defining,covering self-help, business and being a bit of a memoir. Higgins partnered with Shopping.io to allow people to buy the book with cryptocurrency, helping set a new standard for e-commerce.

For crypto to have any underlying support given all the regulatory and contagion fears, inflation risks need to go away.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -4.67%. Data provided by Glassnode", "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) introduced NFTs that are stored entirely on its blockchain. These NFTs can hold up to 4MB of data, enabling the storage of short videos and even the Satoshi whitepaper on the blockchain. This has the potential to make Bitcoin a competitor to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which currently dominates the NFT market, Trustnodes reported. See Also: Small-Cap Altcoin Rallies 88% In A Week To Blow Past Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Gains Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream (which employs many Bitcoin developers), sparked controversy when he called for censorship in a now-deleted tweet: \"Its also fair game for miners to censor the crap as a form of discouragement,\" Back stated. He later retracted his statement, saying, \"I retracted/deleted that as it was stupid and getting misinterpreted.\" Instead, he suggested, \"We can educate and encourage developers who care about Bitcoins use-case to either not do that, or do it in a prunable space-efficient, e.g., time-stamp way.\" The current method used by Ordinals is to store the NFT data in the part of the transaction that holds segregated witnesses, resulting in a 75% reduction in transaction fees compared to other forms of data. This makes the creation of NFTs very cheap, costing around $20, compared to the $140 it would cost in Ethereum. The data is also prunable, meaning it does not need to be stored on the UTXO (transactions memory part of a node), although a synchronizing node must download it. The NFTs are represented as Satoshi, with their serial number used to differentiate them, which was made possible by the Taproot upgrade in 2021. This was originally intended to enable smart contracts on Bitcoin but is now being used to store pictures of the popular meme, Doge. The NFTs are a long string of numbers and letters on the blockchain, which requires specialized software to translate into an actual image. See Also:Is China Embracing Crypto? Tron DAO Founder Praises New Digital Currency Tax Ordinal does not currently have a marketplace, and its website design has been criticized as looking amateurish. However, it does allow users to view the latest Satoshi JPEGs, which are paid for by miners for inclusion. Proponents argue that this benefits the network by adding to miner subsidies, while opponents argue that it is an inefficient way to store images. \"Although considering these are immutable images, it is the most efficient way to store them for long-term accessibility, with miners unlikely to censor as theyre paid fees,\" says the author. \"Devs also might not change the feature because it is probably needed for Blockstream products, at least eventually.\" The highly controversial Segwit upgrade has ultimately resulted in Doge (CRYPTO: DOGE)pictures receiving a 75% reduction in network fees but has not achieved much else. These pictures have double the storage capacity of ordinary transactions, 4MB compared to about 1.8MB, with Bitcoin developers ultimately privileging a use case they dont like. However, this could add about 200GB of data per year, which could be significant without a proper pruning mechanism. \"Satoshi-based assets, however, have not quite taken off,\" says the author. \"There have been many attempts, including Colored Coins, but Bitcoins script language is too limited to really do much.\" The satoshi base of the asset also requires specialized software, rather than just a Bitcoin wallet, which may have contributed to its limited adoption. The absence of a marketplace on Ordinal virtually guarantees a lack of adoption for now, and uncertainty regarding Blockstream's plans makes Ethereum a safer bet.

What Happened: Pal told his 992,000 Twitter followers to identify long-term investment themes with secular tailwinds, as well as potential opportunities that could outpace currency debasement over time. According to Pal, with current investment equities, young investors are increasingly finding it difficult to make any real profits, and Quantitative Easing (QE) and other monetary policies have only exacerbated the situation.

Given where inflation stands, the Fed will likely remain hesitant that a pause is imminent and lean more towards staying hawkish.

As we entered the new year, the value of Bitcoin was around $16,500, but in a matter of about four weeks, it has already risen to over $23,500, resulting in a return on investment of about 41%. This is particularly significant because, in the past, January has usually resulted in negative returns for Bitcoin investors. Looking back at the month of January over the past 10 years, Bitcoin investors have fetched negative returns in six of them, while in the other four, they've fetched double-digit positive gains. The only exception was in 2013 when the returns stood slightly higher at 44%. Also read:Why The White House Is Urging Congress To Increase The Powers Of Cryptocurrency Market Regulators Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), on the other hand, has not seen as much success this month. The largest altcoin was trading in the $1,100-$1,200 bracket during the initial days of January. At the time of writing on Sunday, it was seen hovering around $1,648. As a result, its 2023 return on investment stood at 34%, while in January 2021 and 2018, it registered gains in the 50%-80% range. Despite Ethereum's performance this month, experts predict that the trend may change in the near future. This is due to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which is slated for the first quarter of 2023. The community is gradually turning bullish as the upgrade is expected to bring significant improvements to the network's scalability and security. Additionally, Ethereum recently re-entered the deflationary zone earlier this week, thanks to rising NFT sales. Last year's EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a base-fee burning mechanism with every Ethereum transaction, which helped set the stage for Ethereum to become deflationary. If the quantity of tokens burned remains greater than the number of tokens released, the price is likely to steadily increase as a result of the declining availability. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin also seems to be gearing up to extend its rally. According to Noel Saldanha, a technical analyst, a golden cross is on the verge of materializing on the daily chart, which is a positive sign. A golden cross is typically seen when a shorter-term average line crosses above a long-term average line, indicating upward momentum. Therefore, if the 50-day moving average (DMA) ends up breaking past the 200-DMA, another price uptrend phase can be anticipated.

The crypto sector hadbecome detached from the general market recently, with Bitcoin, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) trading mostly sideways. The sideways consolidation is healthy and needed because the three cryptos relative strength indexes reached overbought territory after massive surges in price, which started in late December. Continued sideways consolidation would help to drop the three cryptos RSI levels. RSI is an indicator technical traders use to measure bullish and bearish price momentum. RSI levels can range between 0 and 100, with levels between 30 and 70 generally considered to be healthy. When a stocks RSI falls below the 30% level, it's considered to be oversold. When a stock enters oversold territory, it indicates the securities price no longer reflects the asset's true value, which can signal a reversal to the upside in the cards. When a stocks RSI rises above the 70% area, it is considered to be overbought. When a stock enters overbought territory, it signals the securities price is elevated to its intrinsic value, which can signal a reversal to the downside on the horizon. RSI is best used when combined with other signals and patterns on a stock chart because stocks can remain in oversold and overbought territory for an extended period of time before reversing.

On Thursday and Friday, Bitcoins consolidation took place in the form of a double inside bar, with all of the price action taking place within Wednesdays 24-hour trading range. On Wednesday and Friday, Bitcoin retraced slightly to test the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) as support and held above the level. The eight-day EMA hadbeen guiding Bitcoin higher Jan. 6 and mightcontinue to act as support. If Bitcoin closedthe trading session near its high-of-day price, the crypto wouldprint a hammer candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come on Saturday. If that happened, traders wouldwant to see Bitcoin burst up above Wednesdays high-of-day on higher-than-average volume, which could indicate a longer-term run is on the horizon. Bearish traders want to see Bitcoin break down from its sideways trading range, which could indicate the current bull cycle has come to an end and a downtrend will occur. Bitcoin has resistance above at $24,206 and $25,772 and support below at $22,729 and $21,313. The Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin hadbeen trading in a sideways pattern and on Thursday and Friday were forming double inside bar patterns. Ethereums sideways pattern was taking place between $1,500 and $1,680. Dogecoin hadbeen consolidating between $0.077 and $0.093 since Jan. 13. Also like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin hadbeen mostly holding above the eight-day EMA, which mightcontinue to guide the cryptos higher. For short-term traders, a close under the eight-day EMA could be a solid exit strategy. Ethereum and Dogecoin bulls want to see the cryptos break up from the horizontal pattern on higher-than-average volume, while bears want to see Ethereum and Dogecoin break bearishly down from the Jan. 18 low-of-days. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,717.41 and $1,957.24 and support below at $1,564.17 and $1,421.80. Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.091 and $0.099 and support below at $0.083 and $0.075.

The 2023 annual meeting of the WEF in Davos, Switzerland, was last week and the focus was onpost-COVID-19 pandemic fragmentation and multipolarity. In attendance were the likes of actor, producer, directorand musician Idris Elba, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyenand First Lady of UkraineOlena Zelenska, among many others. Benzinga attended this years annual meeting to interview leaders in business and government. The following discussion was with Brett McDowell, chairman at Hedera (CRYPTO: HBAR). Please note that the below text was lightly edited for clarity and concision. BZ: Care to start the introduction with a discussion about your background? McDowell: I began my career as the director of information and media technology at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA). This is one of the biggest institutions dedicated to the convergence of media technology and contemporary art. At MASS MoCA, I participated in some consortia. We were in rural America and sought to build a high-tech industrial park and attract companies to host in our facility. I helped represent our interests in the collaborations that ensued. This was my first foray into industry consortia where the members were voting on outcomes to improve the overall local market. Then, in 2002, I joined IEEE. There, I was in charge of a number of industry consortia projects and building standards. Over the next 20 years, I helped big tech companies build coopetition organizations. What was it like trying to have these competitors work with each other? It was a lot of negotiations and consensus-building. We sought to help these organizations have enlightened self-interest, and give away some of their IP, potentially, to the community at large. You spent some time working around digital identities, as well? That was a theme starting with federated identity and, eventually, biometrics and cryptographic identity systems. Liberty Alliance created SAML 2.0. The Kantara Initiative created the Identity Assurance Framework. FIDO Alliance created whats now known as Passkeys. And, there was another one called DMARC, a cybersecurity standard aimed at stopping email-based phishing attacks while I was at PayPal for a while. What was your role at PayPal? I was at PayPal to help work with the community and collaborate and influence public policy. It was my first time working in public policy. Eventually, however, I had invested enough years into biometric and cryptographic identification standards. I was ready to take on a new challenge such as IoT (Internet of Things) because the devices were getting hacked all the time. There were big problems that needed solving. Anyways, I was thinking about blockchains and mentioned it to a person who was working at Hedera at the time. They thought I would be a good fit. I have now been at Hedera since 2019 and focuson the coalition of organizations that make up the Hedera Global Governing Council. You are participating in the World Economic Forum as a speaker? I'm on a panel for digital identification. The World Economic Forum is launching a digital identity initiative housed within CISA, the Crypto Impact Sustainability Accelerator. We will discuss that on the panel, what we are trying to do, why we're trying to do it and what we hope to get from it. Care to talk about your roadmap? Are you pleased with where you sit on that roadmap? Our focus is on bringing added functionality to features that were in a beta oreven an alpha stage, as well as making it really easy for developersstruggling with integrationto have less dependency. So, were making it easier to move your application from Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) to Hedera, and not lose access to some of the market integration that Ethereum has. Adding, staking was a big feature we shipped last year. There is a lot of functionality we would like to add to our staking capability. Thats a part of the roadmap, including some things around decentralization and network maturity features. A big focus, also, is community nodes. Important for the industry is to have permissioned node operators who are operating the infrastructure. This is predicated on trust. How do you trust if you dont know who youre trusting? When we emerged on the scene, we positioned Hedera as a trust layer for the Internet. What we've decided to do is have the node operators be very transparent, as well as affiliated with trusted brands. The companies we work with have far more to lose than they have to gain by colluding with one another to corrupt consensus on the network. We have locked that into our one-to-one mapping of every node operator being a Hedera Governing Council Member. Now, because we are on the long tail path of decentralization  though we still want it known that the Hedera Governing Council makes some decisions  it's our strategy that anyone should be able to run a node down the road. We will get there by introducing community node operators, a new thing that we're going to have known think of them as certified  node operators coming into the network that is not the same thing as a council member. That's a way to get more of our stakeholders, community participantsor application developers into the node operation and governance role. Can you tell me about concerns or challenges that are present, as well as how Hedera comes into the picture to help solve those things? Well, an obvious concern is the way governments reacted to the volatility we saw in 2022. Are they going to overreact? Are they going to misdiagnose the root cause of that volatility and provide a remedy that is a cure that's worse than the disease? Unlike other initiatives, we built a stakeholder group of global Fortune 500 companies, including regulated banks. We believe our voice will be heard differently, and we seek to be a participant and help make sure that any reaction is fit to purpose, well-informed, and on target. Can you discuss use cases that validate a lot of the things were talking about, today? Avery Dennison Corp(NYSE:AVY) wanted to do something to help the world address climate change at scale. They created a startup of their own called atma.io, which has now been built on and is operating on the Hedera network. Thats just the tip of the iceberg, however. It could lead to object identifiers for everything that's manufactured because they're already putting the labels on all those garments, shoes, as well as airplane parts. We've got two other use cases involving tokenization, something that everyone who talks to us is interested in. So, it's the tokenization of carbon credits and offsets, as well as renewable energy credits. Its also the tokenization of real-world assets like real estate. Whats the benefit of tokenizing real-world assets? By tokenizing real-world assets, we can democratize participation in the financial system. Were taking an out-of-reach asset, and putting it in the investors' reach by turning it into much smaller, lower-value components that you can buy and trade. The tokenization of real-world assets is another great project that Toko by DLA Piper is leading. They are powered by Hedera, and there is a synergy between the law firm and the tokenization technology. They're demonstrating that with their clients in the markets that they're in worldwide. What is Hederas biggest differentiator? Its the way we're governed. We're also very collaborative with the competitive networks in that context around standards and policy. I seek to help this whole industry adopt the best practices by learning from the things that we're doing right. Looking out into the future, where do you see Hedera fitting in and solving issues? When a disruptive technology like Web3 comes along, and brings entirely new efficiencies by bringing a lot of that economic activity to a smarter infrastructure, thats where we fit in. Additionally, when it comes to the World Economic Forum, were helping address big challenges including the East-West division and reshoring, ESGand digital identities, for example. There are nearly abillion people in the world who do not have a provable identity. That is where economic opportunity starts. Authentication and identity are critical for us to start pulling people out of poverty and improving the efficiency of the global economy.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Nike made a big splash in the NFT market with the acquisition of RTFKT, a digital sneaker company and owner of the CloneX NFTs. Retailer Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) also put forth aggressive plans for the metaverse that included shopping in virtual stores and the launch of a dedicated themed area inside the Roblox Corp(NYSE:RBLX) game. Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) also launched NFT integration that allowedmerchants to create their own NFTs and sell them. The report said the new NFT initiatives for Amazon would be separate from its Amazon Web Services business, but the possibilities should be considered for the company. Like Shopify, Amazon could offer NFT integration for its website partners. The companys AWS has an NFT explainer listed on its website. Amazon has a massive customer base, including its Amazon Prime members who pay an annual or monthly membership fee for access to free shipping, a video streaming platform and other perks. The report did not indicate if Amazon planned on launching an NFT marketplace, which could become a competitor to market leader OpenSea. The most likely NFT initiatives from Amazon, as mentioned above, could center around gaming and be similar to what GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) previously launched. GameStop used its expertise in the gaming sector to launch an NFT marketplace and to partner with gaming companies for NFTs. Amazon purchased game streaming platform Twitch in 2014, which along with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)-owned YouTube, is one of the largest video game streaming platforms in the U.S. Along with Twitch ownership, Amazon has also released several hit games including Lost Ark, which could give the company an opportunity to launch games that have NFTs integrated in them. The ownership of Amazon Prime Video andMGM Studios also offered the company the chance to make NFTs and digital assets based on hit movies and shows it could also use to promote upcoming series and season premieres. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been open to the idea of the company selling NFTs in the future. I expect that NFTs will continue to grow very significantly, Jassy told CNBC in April 2022. I think its possible down the road on the platform. Jassy also said Amazon was not close to adding cryptocurrency as a payment option for its retail business. The company had been rumored to be exploring more possibilities for cryptocurrency integration at the time. Last year, Amazon.eth Ethereum Name Services (CRYPTO:ENS) domain received a $1 million offer from an anonymous wallet. The ENS was purchased for 33 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) over a year ago.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation.

The ETH address associated with this transaction has been identified as: 0x941b4fdb4b1533ab2cc8b90ff0700f658b4aa642 Why it matters: Whales typically send cryptocurrency from exchanges when planning to hold their investments for an extended period of time. Storing large amounts of money on an exchange presents an additional risk of theft, as exchange wallets are the most sought-after target for cryptocurrency hackers. Ethereum whales that run their own validator nodes (costing 32 ETH each) must send their Ether to the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is then locked up until the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. According to Glassnode, only 16.17% of the total supply remains liquid across all centralized exchanges.

Circle Blames The SEC: Circle said that neither turbulent markets nor fearful investors were the cause of the abandoned deal, stating, The business combination could not be consummated before the expiration of the transaction agreement because the SEC had not yet declared our S-4 registration effective. Quoting a person familiar with the matter, the report said, There was an awfully long time waiting for approvals, and asking questions with the SEC. The person further said that the collapse of Bahamas-based FTX in late 2022 made it impossible for anyone to approve anything because it exposed massive cracks in how crypto groups were managed and showed the potential damage they could cause.

He believes that although Bitcoin may be the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it won't necessarily be the best-performing investment. This is due to the law of large numbers the larger something is, the harder it is to achieve large gains on the same scale. Yusko explains that while Bitcoin possesses the largest market cap at $400 billion, even if it were to reach $4 trillion, that would only be a 10-fold increase. However, if Ethereum, which currently has a market cap of nearly $200 billion, were to reach a similar market cap of $4 trillion, that would be almost twice as much of an increase But if Avalanche actually becomes that intermediate layer, or becomes a bridge to connect Ethereum it could be maybe 50x, he added.

Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers.

Bitcoins pop higher was pulling Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) upin tandem. The crypto market has shown strength in comparison to the general market lately, with many coins and tokens recapturing the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) as support. This could indicate the crypto sector is front running a possible bull cycle in the general market, which would bring hope back to bullish retail traders who sawtheir portfolios dwindle in 2022. For the bear market to officially come to an end, however, the S&P 500 has a long way to go. On top of regaining the 200-day SMA and breaking up through a long-term descending trendline on the daily chart, the S&P 500 needs to rebound 20% from the Oct. 13 low of $3491.58 to negate the current bear market. The S&P 500 has been struggling to pop above the desecending trendline since it fell under the level on Jan. 5, 2022 and most recently rejected the area on Wednesday. Although the crypto sector moves in tandem with the stock market most of the time, there are times at which the two markets disconnect. For Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, the two cryptos look set for new highs, regardless of whether the S&P 500 can break bullishly over the coming days. Want direct analysis?

Both cryptos are trading above the 200-day SMA on the daily chart, with the 50-day SMA trending upwards. If Bitcoin and Ethereum are able to remain well above the 200-day SMA for a period of time, the 50-day SMA will cross above the 200-day, which will cause a golden cross to form. If Bitcoin and Ethereum close Fridays trading session near their high-of-day price, the cryptos will print bullish Marubozu candlesticks, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday.

Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

The ETH address associated with this transaction has been identified as: 0xeaa7723633cf598e872d611f5ec50a45b65cbc72 Why it matters: Whales typically send cryptocurrency from exchanges when planning to hold their investments for an extended period of time. Storing large amounts of money on an exchange presents an additional risk of theft, as exchange wallets are the most sought-after target for cryptocurrency hackers. Ethereum whales that run their own validator nodes (costing 32 ETH each) must send their Ether to the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is then locked up until the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. According to Glassnode, only 16.2% of the total supply remains liquid across all centralized exchanges.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

(@OnChainDen) January 17, 2023 A multisig solution generally has stronger security, but can be less convenient to use since more than one key is required for transactions. Den explains the challenge they are trying to address: Onchain teams are still slower than off-chain teams. They need to be 10x faster to transition the world to a crypto-native economy. Hundreds of multi-sig signers spoke with Den to determine what holds up transactions. Among the challenges: Transactions can take days or weeks. This is a matter of human error as signers can be away from their ledgers, or just forget. Den helps coordinate signers with automatic notifications on Discord and Telegram. Transactions are tedious and time-consuming to understand. Den expresses transactions into user-friendly, plain-language descriptions  and allows users to simulate transactions to remove the hesitation that comes from being unsure you understand the transaction. Transactions can be so hard to create, teams hire outside engineers. Den wishes to help blockchain projects streamline the process and batch transactions so users only need to go through the process once. Den Co-Founder: 'Onchain Asset Storage Is Critical' Benzinga spoke with Den co-founder Jonah Erlich to learn whether recent events in the industry, such as the collapse of FTX (CRYPTO: FTT), put greater emphasis on the need for a faster, on-chain, multisig solution. Onchain asset storage, today in the form of multisigs, is critical for the future of crypto asset storage. Storing assets on centralized exchanges is an unacceptable security risk for our customers, and events such as FTX's collapse, show how pertinent this risk is. Self-custody also presents its own hazards, particularly the fear of being hacked or losing your key. However, the collapse of centralized projects that were custodying funds for customers has put many users squarely in the mantra of your keys, your crypto  a sentiment Den wishes to support. Multisig solutions are the best ways for a team to securely self-custody their assets on-chain today. Den's current focus is making this experience secure, easy, and fast. In the long term, we expect to provide additional on-chain asset storage mechanisms that ensure security and flexibility.

What Happened: Coffeezilla,in a new video post, raised questions about the sincerity of Paul's promises, suggesting that his motivations may be more about avoiding legal action than anything else. Despite Paul's video apology on Twitterand promises to help repay the victims of the scam, Coffeezilla questioned the sincerity of Paul's behavior, noting that parts of his apology and new attitude seemed \"flat.\" See Also: Best Crypto Day Trading Strategies For the uninitiated, Coffeezilla uploaded a three-part series uncovering the details of Paul's project, \"CryptoZoo.\" Paul quickly responded with a threat of legal action, followed by an apology and a $1.3 million refund program for CryptoZoo investors. But now, Coffeezilla has revealed why he believes this refund plan does nothing for most victims of the alleged scam. In a video posted on Wednesday, Coffeezilla said he doesn't want to downplay the gesture that Logan is making by offering refunds of 1000 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) worth $1.3 million to victims, but the scam was much bigger than 1.3 million dollars so the fact is, most victims are not going to be made whole by this plan. Why It Matters: He reiterated that, based on his investigation, Logans team had scammed over $7.7 million. However, he made it clear that this refund does not apply to victims who had bought in-game currency or those who currently hold Zoo coins they will receive nothing. This refund only applies to current egg holders, he emphasized. Coffeezilla explained that crypto has plummeted in value since the launch of Logan's egg holders. Even though holders originally paid 2.5 million for the eggs, a refund at the original mint price would cost only $1.3 million in todays money. He added, Logan had a simple job to do. All he had to do was just come out, apologize, get as much money back for the victims as possible, but he himself cant help but play the victim here.

Ohanian named Yuga Labs as one of the companies looking to solve problems in Web3 and launch a game. As long as folks are building on crypto, as long as theyre spinning up nodes, as long as theyre looking for ways to solve problems, theyre gonna need the picks and shovels to do it, Ohanian said in a CNBC interview.

The sharp decline came in tandem with the broader cypto sector, which reacted negatively to the S&P 500, which attempted to regain a long-term descending trendline as support but failed. Traders are watching for signs of whether the S&P 500 recently regaining the 200-day simple moving average, which occurred on Jan. 13, is an indication of a new bull cycle or if it's another bull trap. Since Jan. 4, 2022, the S&P 500 has regained the 200-day SMA on a few occasions but has been unable to hold above the level. The start of big-tech earnings, which will kick off when Netflix reports its results on Thursday, could help the market begin to choose a longer-term direction. Unlike the S&P 500, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Ethereum Classic hasnt yet regained the 200-day SMA, which means the crypto is in a bear cycle. When Ethereum Classic fell to the low-of-day on Wednesday, however, it didnt negate its current uptrend with a lower low. This indicates the uptrend is intact and if the trend continues, Ethereum Classic could rise up to test the 200-day SMA as resistance over the coming days. Want direct analysis?

The Ethereum Classic Chart: Ethereum Classics most recent higher highwithin its uptrend was printed on Saturday at $23.91 and the most recent confirmed higher low was formed at the $19.44 level on Jan. 11. If Ethereum continues to trend lower on Thursday, bullish traders will want to see the crypto print a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick above $20. If Ethereum starts to recover on Thursday, bullish traders will want to see the crypto pop up above $24 to confirm the uptrend is intact. Another scenario is that Ethereum Classic may trade sideways and print an inside bar ahead of Netflixs earnings. Wednesdays pullback caused Ethereum Classics relative strength index (RSI) to drop from overbought territory (over 70) to about 59. This indicates that if Ethereum Classic starts trading higher, it has room to move without immediately entering into overbought conditions. Ethereum Classic has resistance above at $24.58 and $27.68 and support below at $20.46 and $17.91.

Consolidation across the crypto space is needed because many coins and tokens hadsurged over recent weeks, causing the apex cryptos to regain the important 200-day simple moving average (SMA) as support. Shiba Inu skyrocketed more than42% between Dec. 28 and Saturday and hadsince been consolidating under the 200-day SMA. The 200-day is an important bellwether indicator, which technical traders use to determine if a stock or crypto is in a bull or bear cycle. The 200-day SMA acts as both a heavy area of support and resistance, and stocks and cryptos rarely break up or down through the level on the first attempt. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Shiba Inu Chart: Shiba Inus consolidation under the 200-day SMA was taking place in the form of a triple inside bar pattern. The pattern leans bullish in this case because Shiba Inu was trading higher before forming the inside bars. Traders can watch for Shiba Inu to eventually break up or down from Saturdays mother bar later on Tuesday or over the next few days on higher-than-average volume to indicate the pattern was recognized. If the crypto breaks up from the pattern, it will regain the 200-day SMA, which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward. If Shiba Inu breaks down from the mother bar, traders and investors can watch to see if the crypto prints a reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, above the most recent higher low of $0.00000865. Bearish traders want to see Shiba Inu negate its uptrend by printing either a lower high or a lower low. Shiba Inu has resistance above at $0.00001081 and $0.00001178 and support below at $0.00000975 and $0.00000877.

Land in Decentraland and The Sandbox skyrocketed after Facebook's rebrand to meta, as more investors become aware of what the metaverse is. Most of the time, virtual land sells at a premium due to the size of the lot and its proximity to the center of the metaverse. Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet. As we spend more and more of our time on the internet, the gap between the real world and our online identities declines. Eventually, the metaverse is intended to be an immersive virtual world where people enjoy digital ownership and can interact with their peers. Why it Matters: After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its rebrand to Meta, investors began to pay attention to platforms that are building metaverses.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity. It's unlikely that the investor plans to hold their crypto on Binance, as the security risks of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange are higher than holding these assets in a hardware wallet.

What Happened: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has pushed for changes and to increase revenue at Twitter since acquiring the social media platform for $44 billion in 2022. Twitter could sell off usernames of old accounts via online auctions, according to a report from The New York Times. Sources say talks have been in the works since December to sell off usernames.

Related Link: Elon Musk's Reasons For Buying Twitter, 'I Didn't Do It To make Money, I Did It To Try To Help Humanity' Why Its Important: The big question will be how valuable the 1.5 billion usernames are. The inactive accounts could include one-word usernames, peoples names and potential brands, which could be valuable to the right owner. Twitter usernames are free to create but have to be unique, which means some people may not be able to get their preferred account and have to use something less memorable or identifiable. Twitter does not allow usernames to be bought or sold between users or through marketplaces. While it has not been reported or said by Musk, there is the possibility that Twitter could eventually allow transactions of usernames and take a cut of the payments as a new source of revenue.

The most recent higher low was formed on Jan. 6 at $16,670 and the most recent confirmed higher high was printed on that same day at $17.027. Since then, Bitcoin has surged almost 15% higher, without retracing to print a higher low. This indicateda retracement to the downside was likely on the horizon. The crypto was also likely to trade lower or consolidate over the next few days because Bitcoins relative strength index (RSI) was measuring in at about 84%. When a stocks or cryptos RSI reaches or exceeds the 70% level, it becomes overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders. The consolidation or retracement was likely to come when Bitcoin reaches the 200-day SMA on the daily chart because its a strong area of support and resistance.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity. It's unlikely that the investor plans to hold their crypto on Coinbase, as the security risks of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange are higher than holding these assets in a hardware wallet. It's likely that this Bitcoin whale is planning either on selling Ethereum or trading it for other altcoins. Price Action: Ethereum is up 1% in the past 24 hours.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency. The net annualized issuance rate for Ether yesterday was -5.58%. Data provided by Glassnode", "BTC) spiked up 2.43% at one point during Thursdays 24-hour trading session, leading ETH) about 2.13% higher, prior to the printing CPI data for the month of December. Although the data showed inflation ticked lower for the month ending 2022, with the consumer price index rising 6.5% in December, down from 7.1% in November, the jobs market remains tight. Initial claims for the week ending Jan. 7 came in at 205,000, down 1,000 from the week prior but below the 215,000 jobless claims economists estimated. Traders and investors are hoping the Federal Reserve will continue to ease on hiking rates this year after the December 0.5% hike showed a softening in the central banks policy stance. Although the market wanted to see higher jobless claims to support the CPI data, the strong economy could indicate the Fed is lowering inflation without throwing the U.S. into a recession. From a technical standpoint, the S&P 500 and Ethereum bumped up into their respective 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), which could be why the general market and the crypto sector stalled on a bullish move. The 200-day SMA is a bellwether indicator that suggests whether an index or security is in a bull or bear market, and securities are unlikely to break through the level on the first try. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Bitcoin Chart: Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin hasnt reached the 200-day SMA, trading about 7.8% under the level. While the 200-day SMA isnt acting as resistance for Bitcoin, the cryptos relative strength index (RSI) is trending in oversold territory, which is likely creating resistance. Bitcoin also rejectedits high-of-day near the $18,385 level, which became a resistance level most recently on Dec. 14. If Bitcoin closes the trading day under that level, the crypto will print a shooting star candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come on Friday. Bullish traders would like to see lower prices, or sideways consolidation on Bitcoin, to allow its RSI to cool down. Bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drop Bitcoin down the eight-day exponential moving average, which could cause the stock to negate its current uptrend. Bitcoin has resistance above at $19,915 and $20.545 and support below at $17,580 and $16.797. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum briefly popped up above the 200-day SMA on Thursday before falling back under the level. The crypto may need to trade under that area for a period of time, at least on smaller time frames, before gaining the power to close the 24-hour session above the level. Ethereums RSI is also trending in oversold territory at about 74%. When a stock or cryptos RSI reaches or exceeds 70%, it can be a sell signal for technical traders. If Ethereum closes the trading session near to its opening price, the crypto will print a doji candlestick, which could indicate lower prices are in the cards for Friday. If Ethereum can close near its high-of-day, the crypto will close with a bullish hammer above the 200-day, which could signal higher prices are on the horizon. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,421.80 and $1,564.17 and support below at $1,308.89 and $1,231.28.

He also slammed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly running a months-long campaign against FTX. Here are the top 4 craziest things Bankman-Fried said in his post. See Also: Birds Of A Feather - Bankman-Fried and Madoff Loved To Accumulate Real Estate With Other People's Money I Didnt Steal Funds, Certainly Did Not Stash Billions I didnt steal funds, and I certainly didnt stash billions away, Bankman-Fried said, adding that the majority of his possessions are still being used to support FTX's customers. He also claims to have proposed giving away almost all of his personal shares in Robinhood to customers, or even 100% of his holdings, if the Chapter 11 team agreed to cover his legal expenses for the D&O (directors and officers) indemnification. FTX International and Alameda were both legitimately and independently profitable businesses in 2021, each making billions, Bankman-Fried said. He further said Alameda experienced a significant loss of about 80% of its assets' value due to various market crashes, similar to what happened to Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and other cryptocurrency firms. Additionally, Alameda's assets dropped even more due to a targeted attack and as a result, FTX was affected by Alameda's decline, like Voyager and others were earlier, by 3AC and other companies.

However, the targeted attack in November led to a significant drop in Alameda's assets, where QQQ did not move at all, and the hedges did not end up helping, he added. Binance's PR Campaign Against FTX Recall how Zhao tweeted on Nov. 6 that Binance was liquidating its entire position in FTXs native FTT (CRYPTO: FTT) tokens. The news was devastating for FTX, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried claims that Zhao led a months-long effective campaign against his cryptocurrency exchange prior to this. Over the course of November 7thand 8th, things went from stressful but mostly under control to clearly insolvent. By November 10th, 2022, Alamedas balance sheet had only ~$8b of (only semi-liquid) assets left, versus roughly the same ~$8b of liquid liabilities, he stated. Ridiculous That FTX US Customers Haven't Gotten Funds Back Bankman-Fried said when he passed FTX US off to new CEO John Ray and the Chapter 11 team, it had around $350 million in net cash on hand beyond customer balances. Its funds and customers were segregated from FTX International, he explained. Its ridiculous that FTX US users havent been made whole and gotten their funds back yet, he said.

See Also: Bitcoin Tops $18K Following Inflation Data The ETF will primarily invest in Bitcoin futures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which is known for its futures contracts that are based on the underlying spot price of Bitcoin.

Hong Kong is the only market in Asia where Bitcoin futures ETFs are listed and traded in the institutional market.

Financial Historian Weighs In", "If youve ever dreamed of instantly having hundreds of millions of dollars to buy whatever you want, the Mega Millions might be calling your name on Tuesday. For the fourth time in four years, the jackpot on the Mega Millions lottery drawing has topped the $1 billion mark. Heres a look at the historic jackpot and what you could buy with the after-tax lump sum winnings. What Happened: The Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, is currently listed at $1.1 billion, which is the third-largest jackpot in the games history. The $1.1 billion jackpot trailsonly the $1.537 billion won in 2018 and the $1.337 billion won in July 2022. Tickets cost $2 to play with an additional $1 option cost for a multiplier that raises the nonjackpot winning payouts. Five white balls are drawn numbered 1 to 70 and a gold Mega Ball numbered 1 to 25 is drawn. A person has to match all six to win the overall jackpot. Players can select their own numbers for their tickets, with lucky numbers, birthdays and anniversaries often among the favorite selections. Players can also receive random numbers by selecting an easy pick/quick pick. The overall odds to win the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. The odds to win a prize of at least $4 are 1 in 24. If no one matched all six balls Tuesday night, the jackpot will increase ahead of a drawing on Friday, Jan. 13, 2022. How Much Do You Win?: The jackpot for Tuesdays drawing stands at $1.1 billion with a listed cash payment of $568.7 million. The jackpot is paid out over a 30-year period with an initial payment upon winning and an annual payment for the next 29 years. Each annual payment goes up by 5% to attempt to offset inflation. Given the current high inflation era that we are in, a person who wins the jackpot is immediately tasked with choosing whether they want all the money upfront or to be paid annually and if they think the 5% is enough to offset annual inflation. A winner is responsible for paying federal taxes and any local taxes on the winning. Federal taxes of 37% take the lump sum payout down to $358.28 million. While still a considerable amount, the $1.1 billion jackpot amount trails off pretty quickly if the lump sum is taken and after taxes are paid. What You Can Buy: The winner of the lump sum payout can do what they please with the money after taxes are paid. Heres a look at what the $358.28 million can buy today. 1. S&P 500: If a winner decides to invest the money in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the broad-based S&P 500 Index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies, the $358.28 millioncould purchase 920,082.18 shares of SPY. An investment in the SPY over the last 30years would have outproduced the jackpot winnings with 30 years of annual payouts. BTC), ETH) and DOGE). The winnings would turn into 6,847.42 BTC, 89,164.30 ETH and 1,550,995,671.04 DOGE based on prices at the time of writing. 3. Meme Stocks: Two of the most popular meme stocks over the last two years have been GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc(NYSE:AMC). While it might not be an investment for all, one could take their winnings into these highly volatile stocks. Split evenly, the winnings could buy 10,457,676.59 GME shares and 44,341,584.16 AMC shares. 4. Investing with the Oracle of Omaha: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has been one of the top stock pickers of the last 50 years. While Buffett would tell the winner to put their money into bonds or index funds to preserve wealth, the winner could also choose to trust Buffett and his investments. The winner could buy 1,135,341.40 Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRKA)(NYSE:BRKB). 5. Apple Stock: One of the top-performing stocks of the last 10 years is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Worth over $2 trillion, Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and is likely to remain a market leader for years to come. The $358.28 million winnings could purchase 2,755,364.15 shares of Apple. Related Link: The 10 Most Searched Things In 2022 On Google: Where Did Mega Millions Rank? 6. Tesla Stock: Winning $358.28 million would not put the person on the Bloomberg Billionaires list like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who ranks second with a wealth of $130 billion. But it couldallow the winner the opportunity to buy 3,056,475 shares of Tesla. 7. Tesla Model Ys: One of the most popular electric vehicles globally and a top 10-sellingvehicle in the U.S. is the Model Y from Tesla. A winner could choose to buy a collection of Tesla Model Ys for themselves or to give them away to family members and friends. The winnings could buy 5,429 Tesla Model Ys based on a price of $65,990 each. 8. Real Estate: One popular option for investing at least a portion of the winnings could be real estate. The average home price in the U.S. is $357,544 according to Zillow. The winnings could buy 1,002 average-priced homes in the U.S. The winner could hold the homes to gain value over the years or choose to rent them out for income. Benzinga has a guide on how non-lottery winners can invest in real estate here. 9. Sports Teams: For the ultra-wealthy, buying a professional sports team has been a way to preserve and gain wealth. Despite the large winnings of $358.28 million, the winner might be able to buy an MLS team, with the lowest-valued team worth $390 million. The winnings wouldnt be able to buy a MLB, NBA, NFL or NHL team and might keep the person from acquiring a North American sports franchise. 10. NFTs: Another potential high-risk/high-reward investment could be non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The winning split between two of the largest NFT collections of all time could buy 1,600 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and 2,002 CryptoPunks NFTs. Prices are based on the current floor prices and the winnings would likely buy less than this number, as there are not that many listed at the floor price.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity. It's unlikely that the investor plans to hold their crypto on Coinbase, as the security risks of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange are higher than holding these assets in a hardware wallet. It's likely that this Bitcoin whale is planning either on selling Ethereum or trading it for other altcoins. Price Action: Ethereum is down 0% in the past 24 hours.

With the crypto industry in a bear market, many wonder if a comeback will happen in 2023 or if declining prices will continue this year. Despite the bear market, people were still searching for cryptocurrency charts and top news and headlines on Benzinga Pro. What Happened: The cryptocurrency market started 2022 with a bang, as several of the largest companies in the sector used the Super Bowl as a chance to reach new potential customers. Later in the year, the big story was the collapse of Celsius, 3AC, Voyager and stablecoin Tether (CRYPTO: USDT). The biggest development for many in the sector was the collapse and bankruptcy of FTX. All of these events helped contribute to a decline in the price of major cryptocurrencies.

The OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash first in August and then in November 2022. According to a Chainalysis report, the illicit activity on Tornado Cash was primarily concentrated on two forms of cybercrime: crypto hacks and scams and nearly all the illicit funds received by the service during the 60-day period prior to the sanctions were from stolen funds, with the majority of these funds coming in the form of periodic spikes. One such spike was the Harmony Bridge hack, which occurred in June 2022 and accounted for 65.7% of the mixer's total stolen fund inflows during this period. The sanctions, which targeted Tornado Cash for its role in facilitating money laundering, particularly in relation to funds stolen in cybercrimes associated with North Korea, resulted in the platform's front-end website being taken down, the report stated.

However, the platform's smart contracts can run indefinitely, meaning that anyone can still technically use the service at any time. This suggests that sanctions against decentralized services act more as a tool to disincentivize their use rather than cutting off usage completely, the reportadded. The case of Tornado Cash illustrates the difficulties regulators face when dealing with decentralized crypto entities. Chainalysis stated that with no person or organization able to shut down the service as easily as they would with a centralized platform, it raises questions about the most effective ways to prevent illicit activity on decentralized platforms. Meanwhile, according to recent research from blockchain security company SlowMist, a significant amount of funds flowed through Tornado Cash in 2022.

SOL soared 11% to $16.43 over a 24-hour period at the time of writing. Solana was a casualty of the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research. Everyone knew Solana had deep financial ties with FTX, so it was no surprise that the SOL prices collapsed. Solana was supposed to be the Ethereum killer and it still has a chance if it can survive this dark period. Marcus Sotiriou, a market analyst with GlobalBlock, noted that Solana is performing well after the non-fungible token community united following the exit of the two most valuable NFT projects  DeGods and Y00ts which have moved to Ethereum and Polygon (MATIC) respectively. This shows the resilience of the Solana NFT community, providing optimism for SOL token holders. A meme coin, BONK, was airdropped to many Solana NFT communities, excluding DeGods and y00ts, and climbed almost 50x in the space of a week, which further united the Solana NFT community, said Sotiriou.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever.

Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency.

The three cryptos have shown strength compared to the general market since the end of December, trading in steady uptrends, although with a lower level of volatility than is usually expected. In contrast, the S&P 500 chopped mostly sideways during that time frame, except for Friday, when the index broke up from the horizontal pattern. Dogecoins spike higher caused the crypto to regain support at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), while Ethereum was working up higher toward that area. The 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock or crypto trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a crypto trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle. The 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs, whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place. Want direct analysis?

During Sunday and Mondays 24-hour trading sessions, Bitcoin was spiking up above the most recent higher high, but hasnt yet flashed a signal the temporary top is in. Eventually, Bitcoin will print a bearish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, which could indicate the next higher high is in, and a retracement will take place. When that happens, bullish traders will want to see the crypto bounce up off the eight-day exponential moving average. Bitcoin has resistance above at $17,580 and $19,915 and support below at $16,797.28 and $16,000. The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum reversed into its most current uptrend on Dec. 19.

During Mondays 24-hour trading session, Ethereum was charging higher but, like Bitcoin, the crypto hasnt shown signs the next higher high has occurred. If Ethereum continues to push higher over the next few days, the crypto is likely to find resistance at the 200-day SMA.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space.

Why it matters: Abnormally large cryptocurrency transfers from wallets to exchanges is typically a bearish signal. Most high networth cryptocurrency traders hold their funds on a hardware wallet, as these devices offer better security than cryptocurrency exchanges. Hardware wallets store investors' private keys offline, securing their digital assets from online hacks. When whales transfer Ethereum onto an exchange, this typically means they are looking for liquidity. It's unlikely that the investor plans to hold their crypto on Coinbase, as the security risks of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency on an exchange are higher than holding these assets in a hardware wallet.

BONK, which appreciated by over 3,300% to a peak of $0.00000487, is currently trading down around 55% at 0.00000195, according to data from CoinGecko. While the tokens team was probably hopingthe current hype can channel increasing demand for the BONK token, a closer look at its tokenomics casts a long shadow over the premise. What Happened:With a total token supply of 100 trillion BONK tokens, with 56 trillion of them already in circulation, the latest memecoin dwarfedpeers such as Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) when it cameto market dilution. The fluctuation in the value of the BONK token was reminiscent of the unstable nature of other memecoins that gained popularity in the past, such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and FLOKI (CRYPTO: FLOKI), which are based on the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain. These memecoins were inspired by the Shiba Inu dog, which hadbecome a popular symbol in the cryptocurrency world due to its association with the \"doge\" meme. Having already airdropped more than50% of it to several early benefactors, the latest meme cryptocurrency seemedlike a desperate attempt to bring back Solanas lost luster. Also Read:Liquidators Subpoena Founders Of Failed Crypto Hedge Fund Three Arrows Capital Via Twitter Interestingly, Solana blockchain severed ties with FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried-promoted liquidity provider Serum and hadbeen pursuing major updates in a bid to win back decentralized finance (DeFi) users. The Solanatoken lost more than 90% of its value over the past year and was suffering from falling transaction volumes across its burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. Why It Matters: The Solana blockchainevolved Serum into OpenBook and launched the BONK token to give Solanas users more control over the functioning of its entire ecosystem. Despite touting the BONK token as being the potential enabler to return Solana to DeFi supremacy, the BONK whitepaper detailedvery little of how it aims to achieve this. Furthermore, with almost all of its current circulating supply distributed amongst selected participants, demand for the BONK token would probably outstrip its supply only untilthe present euphoria survives. While 50% of BONK tokens hadalready been airdropped to OpenBook traders, artists, collectors, developersand a collection of 40 Solana NFT projects, another 20% hadbeen allocated to 22 individuals who contributed to launching the meme token. Of the remaining 30% of the total BONK tokens, 15% hadbeen allocated to the BONK DAO that hadbeen entrusted with furthering initiatives conceived by the BONK community, while 5% each hadbeen set aside for marketing, providing initial liquidity and for future developments. And yet, data from decentralized protocol Orca indicatedliquidity providers were earning an hourly fee rate of 1% for providing liquidity through the BONK/SOL pair trade, totaling to an astonishing 8,760% APR for those staking their BONK tokens. While it seemedcertain such extraordinary returns would only be possible in the short term, a return to normal yields would compel BONK token holders to dump the tokens and pocket their profits. The consequences of the latter scenario wouldbe counterintuitive to BONKs ulterior motive of providing liquidity to Solanas flourishing DeFi ecosystem. This would warrant the tokens creators to resort to other marketing tactics or flood the market with more tokens, thereby exerting further downward price pressure on the BONK token. Despite emerging as the top-performing cryptocurrency in the past week, the BONK token has its work cut out and will have to amass a lot of investor interest in the near future if it has to live up to its goals.

What Happened: Michel is accused of assuring purchasers that their NFTs would gain greater worth, plus incentive rewards for holding them. In reality, it appears Michel misused the $2.9 million in user funds for his own benefit. During subsequent talks with customers on social media, Michel confessed to \"rugging\"  an expression used when a programmer raises finances for a venture and then disappears with those assets  but insisted that it was caused by the divisive NFT community. \"We never intended to rug but the community went way too toxic,\" Michel was quoted as saying according to a Department of Justice release.

Arvelo, a Homeland Security special agent, declared that Michel has been badly accused of conducting a \"rug pull\"scheme, resulting in the deception of roughly $3 million from investors that he kept for himself. People who bought Mutant Ape Planet NFTs believed they were investing in a trendsetting collectible item, yet they had been tricked and did not gain any of the anticipated benefits. Michel, who is of French origin and hailsfrom the United Arab Emirates, was apprehended at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

Ethereum's blockchain is home to open world metaverses, with the 2 largest being Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA) and The Sandbox (CRYPTO: SAND). Brands like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Atari (OTC:PONGF) have bought virtual land in these blockchain-based metaverses, and some companies believe that much of retail will eventually happen within the metaverse. The term metaverse is used to describe the evolution of human's interaction with the internet.

CNBC Samsung's Consumer-Products Chief And Analysts Expect Demand Headwinds To Improve From Second Half Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd(OTC:SSNLF) consumer-gadgets Vice Chair and co-CEO Han Jong-hee hoped the current industry downturn that affected the company's profit trajectory would begin to improve in the second half of 2023. Analysts expect Samsung to report 7.18 trillion South Korean won ($5.64 billion) in operating profit in the December quarter, down 50% Y/Y. However, some analysts are more bearish than the consensus. The pessimism stemmed from a rapid fall in NAND and DRAM memory prices due to demand softness for the products like PCs.

Friedberg also reportedly revealed details of Alameda Research and how its customer funds were used to finance Bankman-Fried's business empire, as well as conversations he had with other top executives.

What Happened: Dubbed as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) spin-off ETC has rallied more than 24% in the past 24 hours, topping intraday gains at $19.52. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, ETC is witnessing a massive rally. Not only is trading volume unusually high, but there is also a massive influx of shorts by traders on exchanges,suggesting that this rally could stretch further. See More: Best Crypto Day Trading Strategies It appears that the recent, sudden rise in price could be partly due to a short squeeze. This usually occurs when a high number of traders make bearish bets on an asset and its value instead increases. Investors appear to be anticipating a potential regulatory crackdown on Ethereum later this year, which could explain why Ethereum Classic's price is jumping. Last year, Ethereum underwent a major overhaul known as The Merge, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to a proof-of-stake (PoS). These upgrades are meant to make the platform faster and more reliable, although the new staking features mean that it could be subject to increased governmental oversight, particularly within the U.S., where the SEC regards Ethereum as a financial security. Therefore, it's possible that the recent price surge was driven by the anticipation of forthcoming regulations. Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $12,544, up 2.7%.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed 0.75% and 0.7% higher, respectively, on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee were released. The U.S. Federal Reserves language on the economy was considerably bullish but the central bank said it will take whatever measures necessary to tame inflation but at the same time said it may continue to soften its tightening measures. In December, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.5% after raising rates by 0.75% in four consecutive hikes over five months. Bitcoin is getting a minor boost today as risky assets rally as more signs emerge that inflation is coming down, said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA. Disinflation trends might be improving in Europe, but the US outlook is getting complicated by a strong labor market.  Cryptocurrencies seem unfazed by all the warnings coming from all the banking regulators, said Moya in a note, seen by Benzinga. Investors will look ahead to Fridays nonfarm payrolls data, unemployment rate, and hourly wages all of which could have a bearing on the Federal Reserves move on interest rates.

A potential rally over the high-of-day at the $1,272 mark looked promising before the Federal Open Market Committee released its monthly meeting minutes at 2 p.m., which brought an initial high level of bearish volatility. While the Fed said that bringing down inflation remains its top priority, the central bank may continue to soften its tightening measures to avoid a recession. Although the Feds language was moderately bullish, the S&P 500 failed to break up or down from Tuesdays trading range.

The crypto sector has traded in tandem with the general stock market recently, but Ethereum has shown relative strength, gaining over 10% since Dec. 19. In contrast, the S&P 500 has declined about 0.3% since that date and Bitcoin has gained a mere 0.5%. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Ethereum Chart: While the S&P 500 and Bitcoin have been trading mostly sideways, Ethereum reversed into an uptrend on Dec. 19 and has made a consistent series of higher highs and higher lows. Ethereums most recent higher high was printed on Dec. 22 at $1,238.76 and the most recent higher low was formed at the $1,180.44 mark on Dec. 30. On Wednesday, Ethereum created another high, but traders will need to see the price action that takes place on Thursday to know whether the next higher high has occurred. If Ethereum closes the trading session with a long upper wick, the crypto may trade lower on Thursday. The second most likely scenario is that Ethereum forms an inside bar pattern on Thursday, with all of the price action taking place within Wednesdays range. If that occurs, the pattern leans bullish because the crypto was trading higher prior to forming the inside bar. Bearish traders want to see big bearish pressure come in and break Ethereum down under $1,180, which would negate the uptrend. Ethereum has resistance above at $1,308.89 and $1,421.80 and support below at $1,231.28 and $1,081.

(NYSE:JPM) lounge in Decentraland (CRYPTO: MANA), witnessed multi-fold price appreciation during late 2021 and early 2022. Since then, the value of that virtual land has been on a downward trajectory. The average sale price of all virtual land sold on Decentraland in December 2022 was $1,878. That's roughly a 60% drop from the corresponding figure of $4,683 in February 2022, according to Dune Analytics' Virtual Land Dashboard.

These projects drew hordes of investors, celebrities and big-name companies: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. (OTCPK: SSNLF): The electronics giant launched Samsung 837X in Decentraland last February. Adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY): The sportswear company made a splash when it announced its \"Into the Metaverse\" initaitive and associated non-fungible tokens (NFTs). PricewaterhouseCoopers: The international accounting firm bought metaverse land in The Sandbox last January, expecting it to \"create value through innovative business models\" and engage with their customers. Molson Coors Beverage Co. (NYSE:TAP): The brewer opened the \"Meta Lite Bar\" with virtual beer as part of a promotional tie-in with last year's Super Bowl. JPMorgan Chase: The bank's virtual lounge is named Onyx, after its platform of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) based services. Onyx is located in Decentralands Metajuku mall and features a jpeg image of CEO Jamie Dimon. Celebrities such as DJ Marshmello, Paris Hilton and Justin Bieber added to the euphoria surrounding the metaverse, with their avatars performing at events hosted in this virtual world. Benzinga's Take: The digital NFT land market is drying up. Platforms like Sandbox and NFT Worlds saw their average sale prices fall ~70% and ~93% respectively over the course of the last year. The total value of land sold per month has fallen drastically, with Decentraland recording just $568,279 in sales in December 2022. Compare this with its $5.18 million monthly sales figure in January 2022. As a result, crypto investors who invested in these digital NFT lands during the boom cycle are not only staring at huge losses on their investments but are also in a dilemma of whether to purchase more virtual land or simply exit their investments. Meanwhile, billionaires are apparently shunning the speculative digital NFT land market in favor of actual land. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have been acquiring thousands of acres of farmland across the U.S. Larry Ellison and Tilman Fertitta are scooping up luxury resort properties. Even though the metaverse, and companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), are rapidly advancing and offering increasingly immersive experiences to users, it is anyones guess whether crypto enthusiasts will see their digital NFT land investments recovering in the year ahead.

Ethereum whales that run their own validator nodes (costing 32 ETH each) must send their Ether to the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is then locked up until the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. According to Glassnode, only 16.01% of the total supply remains liquid across all centralized exchanges.

The spike higher contrasted with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), which were struggling to trade flat amid the bearish action of the S&P 500. On Dec. 29, the crypto fell under the $10 mark for the first time in almost two years, but the most recent downtrend began on Nov. 6, when information first emergedindicating Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX platform was in trouble. Between that day and Nov. 9, Solana plunged over 67% before beginning to consolidate sideways above a support level at $11.26. When the crypto fell under that area on Dec. 27, technical traders may have predicted another drop was in the cards. Bankman-Fried had shown support for Solana, which may have spooked traders and investors, especially because Solana has seen fraudulent developer activity in the past, according to a report. Solana also suffered several outages in 2022, which caused some investors to shy away from the crypto. In December, Solana saw\"DeGods\" and \"Y00ts,\" two of the top non-fungible token (NFT) projects on the platform, announcing that they will be leavingthe SOL ecosystem. Although Solanas recent rebound will be a relief for investors who hold the crypto at higher prices, SOL has a lot of work to do in order to prove the price action is more than a short-term bounce. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Solana Chart: After Solana reached the $8 low on Dec. 29, the crypto bounced up to print a doji candlestick, which indicated a bounce was in the cards. Because short-term bounces take place within downtrends, however, theres currently no indication that the longer-term bottom is in. For Solana to negate its current downtrend, the crypto will either have to shoot up above $15 or retrace to print a higher low above $8. Unless either happens over the next several days, the most likely scenario is that Solana will continue to trend lower over the next few weeks. During Tuesdays 24-hour trading session, Solana was attempting to break up above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) but was struggling to regain the area as support. If Solana closes the trading days under the 50-day SMA, the crypto will print a bearish shooting star candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come on Wednesday. Bullish traders who arent already in a position may choose to wait and see if Solana eventually falls lower and prints a bullish reversal candlestick above $8 to take a position. Solana has resistance above at $14.96 and $19.16 and support below at $11.26 and $8.

Burning is when a coin or token is sent to an unusable wallet to remove it from circulation. Why it matters: On August 5th, 2021, the Ethereum blockchain implemented an important upgrade known as EIP-1159. This Ethereum improvement proposal changed the fee model drastically. Now each transaction includes a variable base fee that adjusts according to the current demand for block space. This base fee is burned, or permanently removed from circulation, lowering the supply of Ether forever. See Also: How to Buy Ethereum & When Will Ethereum 2.0 Launch Ethereum is currently issuing new Ether at a rate of 4% per year, although this is expected to decrease to around 0.5-1% as a part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Once this occurs, many speculate that the burn rate of Ether will be greater than the token's issuance, causing ETH to become a deflationary currency.

The ETH address associated with this transaction has been identified as: 0xf362d4176d5676d82c96f427dce7c6ae30ed0e7c Why it matters: Whales typically send cryptocurrency from exchanges when planning to hold their investments for an extended period of time. Storing large amounts of money on an exchange presents an additional risk of theft, as exchange wallets are the most sought-after target for cryptocurrency hackers. Ethereum whales that run their own validator nodes (costing 32 ETH each) must send their Ether to the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, which is then locked up until the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022. According to Glassnode, only 16.01% of the total supply remains liquid across all centralized exchanges. The removal of ETH from an exchange reduces potential sell side pressure, allowing the price of Ether to increase more easily.

While 2022 may not have been on the same level as sales volume in2021, the yearsaw many of the top collections from the previous year post strong secondary sales. Several new collections also launched in 2022 and have climbed their way up the all-time sales volume leaderboard. What Happened: NFTs continued to be a trending topic in the cryptocurrency sector and one of Benzinga's many areas of coveragein 2022. From hosting aNFT show on YouTube; Twitter Spaces discussing Web3; and our firstin-person crypto event in New York City in 2022, NFTs were top of mind for Benzinga. As the new year begins, heres a look at the top 10 NFT collections by sales volume in 2022. The list uses data from CryptoSlam through Dec. 20, 2022 and was reported by Decrypt. 1. Bored Ape Yacht Club, $1.57 billion: The original collection from Yuga Labs was the top-selling NFT collection in 2022 with over $1.5 billion in sales volume. The collection, which minted in April 2021, ranks second of all-time, behind only Axie Infinity for NFT sales volume. The launch of ApeCoin (CRYPTO: APE) and Otherdeed for Otherside NFTs were among the catalysts that helped keep Bored Ape Yacht Club front and center. 2. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, $1.14 billion: Like Bored Ape Yacht Club, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection likely saw increased interest in 2022 thanks to the launch of ApeCoin and Otherdeeds, two items that were allocated to holders of Yuga Labs assets. Mutant Ape Yacht Club has more items in its collection and a lower entry price than Bored Ape Yacht Club, which may have made it an investment or trade for more people in 2022. 3. Otherdeed for Otherside, $1.1 billion: The newest collection from Yuga Labs launched in 2022 with a claim for all Bored Ape and Mutant Ape holders and a public mint that saw massive demand. The NFT collection, which will play a key part in the Otherside metaverse from Yuga Labs, became the third launch from Yuga Labs to pass sales volume of $1 billion. 4. Azuki, $849.9 million: Launched in January, Azuki was one of the biggest success stories of 2022 and ranks as the top new mint of 2022 that wasnt from a new collection. The collection topped the sales charts for several weeks, even doing more in sales than Bored Apes and CryptoPunks on several occasions. A free airdrop to Azuki holders called Beanz also saw a surge in sales transactions later in 2022. 5. Moonbirds, $613.4 million: Another new 2022 collection ranks among the top five collections for the year with Moonbirds. Launched in April from Proof, the collection had huge initial demand and saw sales volume of 50,000 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) in its first day of trading. Proof has raised additional funds and counts Alexis Ohanian as an investor. Moonbirds could continue to be a project to watch in 2023.

CloneX, $600.5 million: Launched in 2021 from RTFKT, the popular collection saw continued strength in 2022. The strength came after it was announced in December that Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) was acquiring RTFKT to push forward its growth plan for Web3. 7. CryptoPunks, $575.2 million: One of the first NFT collections on Ethereum was CryptoPunks, launched by Larva Labs in 2017. One of the biggest news stories for NFTs was Yuga Labs announcing it was acquiring the rights to CryptoPunks and Meebits from Larva Labs in March. Yuga has announced several plans for CryptoPunks going forward. 8. Doodles, $391.6 million: One of the biggest collections from 2021, Doodles carried over momentum in 2022 with several funding rounds that saw Ohanian invest in the project. The company also announced a new CEO coming from Billboard to lead the project and the appointment of Pharrell Williams as chief brand officer. 9. Sorare, $318.1 million: Sprots and entertainment NFT collection Sorare was one of the top NFT collections in 2022,launching digital trading cards and games for both Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. The company also celebrated the 2022 World Cup with a global challenge featuring some of the top teams and competing players. 10. Axie Infinity, $291.1 million: Play-to-earn game Axie Infinity was one of the biggest success stories of 2021 and the top NFT on a weekly basis for many of the weeks of the year. In 2022, the project saw momentum fade away with play-to-earn being an area of Web3 that struggled. A new version of the game launched and several updates helped bring some momentum back to the game, but the collection saw sales of under $1.5 million in the month of November, a far cry from what the project was previously doing. Axie Infinity still ranks as the all-time leader in NFT collection sales at north of $4 billion.

Panic spread across the crypto market, despite FTXs reassurances that they were financially stable.
